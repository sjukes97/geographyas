Since the 1400s, the World's population has experienced nothing but continuous growth despite wars, famines and epidemics. Just over 50 years ago in 1960, the total human population was little over 3 Billion. In 2012, it surpassed 7 Billion[^1] and continues to grow today. 

The rapid, exponential growth of the human population started in the 1960s. Before then, the world's population had been increasing but not at a particularly fast rate. In the 1960s though, everything changed. Between 1960 & 1965, the global crude death rate[^2] fell nearly 25% from 17.66 to 13.33 deaths per thousand people. At the same time, the crude birth rate[^3] increased by nearly 8% from 31.76 births per thousand people to 34.34. From 1965 the death rate fell a further 38% to its present day (2011) value of 8.11 while the birth rate has also fallen 43% to 19.3. Despite this fall, the natural increase has remained high so the world's population has continued to grow. Models predict that the world's population growth will begin to taper off around the turn of the 22<sup>nd</sup> century but there are many variables that could hasten or postpone this prediction[^4].

*Natural increase*, *crude birth rate*, *crude death rate*? There's a good chance you've never come across these terms before so here's a few quick definitions:

Crude Birth Rate (CBR)
:	The total number of births per 1,000 people per year.

Crude Death Rate (CDR)
:	The total number of deaths per 1,000 people per year.

(Rate of) Natural Increase (RNI)
:	The difference between the crude birth and death rate. A quick formula to get the RNI as a percentage is \\(RNI = \frac{CBR - CDR}{10} \\).

Although I haven't used this term yet, **do not** confuse *rate of natural increase* with *population growth rate*. They are very different things. So you don't get confused, here's a definition of growth rate:

Population Growth Rate (PGR)
:	PGR is typically a representation of the percentage change of a population over a period of time. To calculate it, take the population at time 1 and subtract it from the population at time 2. Then, divide by the population at time 1 and multiply by 100. Boom, you've got yourself a growth rate. For the mathematically inclined: \\(\frac{dP}{dt} = \frac{P_{t2} - P_{t1}}{P_{t1}} \times 100\\).

## Individual Country's Population Growth

The world, as it stands at the moment, doesn't exist as a single state but rather as multiple sovereign states or countries. You may or may not be aware of this. The socioeconomic conditions of these many countries that make up the world vary wildly for a vast array of reasons. It's because of these variations in conditions though that different countries are experiencing wildly different population growth rates. 

In a very general sense, the world's least developed countries, most of which are found in sub-saharan Africa, Eurasia & the west Pacific, have high birth rates and lower but still high death rates. South Sudan, for example, officially classified as a Least Developed Country (LDC) by the United Nations, has a crude birth rate of 29.94, 40% higher than the global birth rate and a death rate of 8.31, nearly 90% higher than the global death rate.

[^4]: I like to think that by the 22<sup>nd</sup> century, the world's governments will have gotten their as### in gear and invested some resources in colonising other celestial bodies. Doing so would require advancements in food & water production and would mean we'd have a hell of a lot more space for people to live, solving our overcrowding problem & our supply problem allowing us to keep on growing.
