                <content type="html"><![CDATA[ <h2 id="location">Location</h2>

<p>The Isle of Purbeck is located in the south of England in Dorset. Its area is approximately 200km<sup>2</sup> and the south and east of the area are surrounded by sea (the English Channel). The north is divided by the River Frome and Poole Harbour. There is one town, Swanage, several villages and a seaside resort. Access to the Isle of Purbeck is provided via the A351 road which is linked to the Poole-Bournemouth conurbation (population 500,000). </p>

<h2 id="population">Population</h2>

<p>In the past 40 years, the population has grown and, in 2001, the population was 44,400. This population is substantially older than the rest of England, with 21.77% of the population over 65 in the Isle of Purbeck versus 15.89% in the rest of England. The reason for this is likely due to the attractiveness of the area for retirement. In addition, a large number of young people are migrating out of the area, in search of employment. </p>

<p>The death rate in the area (in general) was 11.9 per thousand and the birth rate was 10.1 per thousand in 2001. Looking at more specific areas, in Studland the death rate was 19.6 per 1000, again, largely due to the high proportion of elderly people. </p>

<p>Ethnic diversity in the Isle of Purbeck is minimal. 98.8% of the population is white, versus 90.9% in the rest of England. According to the 2001 census, the ethnic groups where distributed as follows in the Isle of Purbeck:</p>

<table>
  <thead>

<h2 id="housing-problems">Housing Problems</h2>

<p>The cost of housing in the area has risen exponentially in the past few years, thanks largely to migrants, second home owners &amp; retirees. As there’s a lot of people trying to purchase a small number of homes, the cost of the homes has risen, forcing locals out of the area. This problem is further worsened due to the low pay, or lack of, jobs. </p>

<h2 id="services">Services</h2>

<p>The quantity and quality of services in the Isle of Purbeck has seen a sharp decline in recent years. General stores have become rare, with three out of four villages having no general store. Post offices have been closing as have petrol stations and public houses. Conversely, the number of general practices has been rising in the area. Since 1991, nine surgeries have opened and no schools have been closed.</p>

<p>Comparing the services of villages within the Isle of Purbeck, there appears to be some variety in their availability. The village of Corfe Castle, a prominent tourist destination, has significantly more services than less important villages, such as Langton Matravers, despite their similar populations (980 &amp; 910 respectively). Langton Matravers lacks a post office, petrol station, general store, GP surgery or any food shops. Comparatively, Corfe Castle has 16 shops, a petrol station, post office and 4 public houses. </p>

<h2 id="public-transport">Public Transport</h2>

<p>Due to the lack of services in villages such as Langton Matravers, public transport is essential in order to allow people to go about their day to day activities so that they can access distant services. Unfortunately, public transport in the whole area of the Isle of Purbeck is incredibly poor. There are a total of four bus routes covering the area and a ferry. The village of Wareham is on the Waterloo to Weymouth line though. </p>

<p>The densest areas are found in central Leeds in wards such as Harehills and Headingley. Here the population density exceeds 44 people per hector. To the south west and west of central Leeds, the population is still reasonably dense but not as dense as in the centre, with a density of around 11 - 44 people per hector. To the north, north east &amp; the east of Leeds, the population is far less dense, with 0 - 11 people per hector. The larger wards, such as Barwick &amp; Kippax, aren’t particularly dense. </p>

<p>According to census data, significantly more people live in the outer suburbs than in the inner city. Around 6,000 more people live in the suburbs. Despite this, the density in the outer suburbs is only 3.44 people per hector whereas the density in the inner city is around 20.93 people per hector. Significantly more people own their homes in the suburbs while only 28% rent property. Nearly half of the people living in the suburbs live in detached homes, while half of the population in the inner city live in terraced homes. The average weekly income in the suburbs is nearly double that in the inner city with the income being £680 and £370 respectively. Employment rates are similar in both the inner city and suburbs, with unemployment being about 5% lower in the suburbs. Generally, people in the suburbs regard their health to be better than those in the inner city. 73% of people in the suburbs were happy with their help versus 63% in the inner city. Finally, ethnic groups vary greatly between the inner city and the suburbs. In the suburbs, 98% of the population is white. In the inner city, this falls to 85%, with 12% being Asian, 2% black and 1.5% mixed.</p>

                <content type="html"><![CDATA[ <h2 id="location">Location</h2>

<p>Migration from Mexico to the United States Of America primarily involves the movement of Mexicans from Mexico to the southern states of America which border Mexico. In order to gain access to America, Mexicans must cross the “Unites States-Mexico Border”, a border which spans four US states &amp; six Mexican states. In America, it starts in California and ends in Texas (east to west). Due to their proximity to the border &amp; the high availability of work in these states, the majority of Mexicans move to California followed by Texas. California currently houses 11,423,000 immigrants with Texas holding 7,951,000. </p>

<p>Many Mexicans from rural communities migrate to America, the majority being males who move to America and then send money back to their families in Mexico. Many of these immigrants enter the country illegally, which often requires them to cross a large desert that separates Mexico and America and the Rio Grande. These journeys are dangerous and many immigrants have died, or nearly died, trying to cross into America through these routes. </p>

<h2 id="reasons-for-migration">Reasons for Migration</h2>

<h3 id="push-factors">Push Factors</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>There are incredibly high crime rates in Mexico, especially in the capital. Homicide rates come in at around 10-14 per 100,000 people (world average 10.9 per 100,000) and drug related crimes are a major concern. It is thought that in the past five years, 47,500 people have been killed in crimes relating to drugs. Many Mexicans will move out of fear for their lives and hope that America is a more stable place to live, with lower crime rates. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unemployment and poverty is a major problem in Mexico and has risen exponentially in recent years. In 2000, unemployment rates in Mexico were at 2.2, however, in 2009, they rose by 34.43%, leaving them standing at 5.37 in 2010. A large portion of the Mexican population are farmers, living in rural areas where extreme temperatures and poor quality land make it difficult to actually farm. This is causing many Mexican families to struggle, with 47% of the population living under the poverty line. With these high unemployment and poverty rates, people are forced to move to America, where they have better prospects, in order to be able to support their families and maintain a reasonable standard of living. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The climate and natural hazards in Mexico could force people to move to America. Mexico is a very arid area which suffers from water shortages even in the more developed areas of Mexico. The country also suffers from natural disasters including volcanoes, earthquakes, hurricanes &amp; tsunamis. Recent natural disasters could force people to migrate if their homes have been destroyed or made uninhabitable. People who live in danger zones could also migrate out of fear for their lives. </p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="pull-factors">Pull Factors</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>There is a noticeable difference in the quality of life between America &amp; Mexico. Poverty, as mentioned above, is a major issue in Mexico, with 6% of the population lacking access to “improved” drinking water. Mexico’s infrastructure is severely undeveloped when compared to America’s. Despite being the 11<sup>th</sup> richest country in the World, Mexico also has the 10<sup>th</sup> highest poverty. With America offering significantly better living standards and services, such as health care, people are enticed to move to America for a better life. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Existing migrant communities in states such as Texas and California help to pull people towards migration. Existing communities make it easier for people to settle once moved and family members &amp; friends who have already moved can encourage others to move. People are also enticed to move in order to be with their families. Cousins and brothers will often move in with their relatives after they have lived in America for a while in order to be with their family.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>86.1% of the Mexican population can read &amp; write versus 99% of the population in America. In addition, the majority of students in Mexico finish school at the age of 14, versus 16 in America. These statistics show that there are significantly better academic opportunities in America than in Mexico, which can entice Mexicans to migrate for an improved education, either for themselves or, more likely, their future children, in order to give them more opportunities in the world and allow them to gain higher paying jobs. </p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="impacts">Impacts</h2>

<h3 id="social">Social</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Assimilation of Mexicans into American communities has been problematic. Many Mexicans can’t speak fluent English and studies show that their ability to speak English doesn’t improve drastically whilst they live in the US. This is largely due to them living in closed communities of other Mexican immigrants which reduces their need to assimilate with America. This can, in turn, create tension between migrants and locals which can, in extreme cases, lead to segregation, crime and violence. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are concerns that immigrants are increasing crime rates in areas that they migrate to. Low income &amp; poor education are factors which can lead to crime. In addition, as Mexico is a country associated with drug trafficking, there are concerns that Mexican migrants could be smuggling drugs into America, creating the problem of drug related crimes. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The introduction of Mexican cultural traditions to America, especially in states with large numbers of migrants, have helped to improve cultural aspects of those states. Mexican themed food has become incredibly popular in America with burrito and taco fast food shops opening up across the country. The new food &amp; music has helped to improve the cultural diversity of America significantly. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With such a large number of Mexican migrants not speaking English fluently, it is now common for Spanish to be taught in American schools, widening the skill set of the younger population and improving the potential career opportunities that students may have. This also (slightly) helps ease social tensions caused by people speaking different languages which locals don’t understand.  </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With so many young people leaving Mexico, its developing an increasingly dependant population as the majority of people left are the elderly who can not work. Furthermore, the lack of young fertile couples is reducing the birth rate in Mexico, further increasing the dependency ratio as there is no workforce to pay taxes to support the elderly. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The majority of migrants leaving Mexico are males leaving a population with a high number of females. This is problematic as they are unable to find partners, get married and, in a mostly catholic country, have children (out of wedlock). This is, as mentioned above, reducing the birth rate and increasing the dependency ratio.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="economic">Economic</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Mexican migrants often take low paying, menial jobs, which, while low paying, offer higher wages than what they’d earn in Mexico. This was, at first, advantageous, as many Americans did not want these low paying jobs but companies needed people to fill these jobs. Now, as unemployment rises in America, Americans want these menial jobs but many migrants already have taken the jobs. This can lead to increased social tension as Americans believe that their jobs are being taken. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Migrants work at incredibly low wages. Americans who are desperate for work are now often expected to work at these incredibly low wages too, which they can’t afford to do, leading to increased poverty in America. Many companies are now also replacing American labour with cheaper migrant labour, also increasing unemployment rates are people are forced out of their jobs.</p>

    <p>While legal Mexican migrants are working &amp; paying taxes, they often send money they earn back to their families in Mexico, rather than spending it in America, which can effect the country’s economy as there is less money being spent on products which are taxed in America. Conversely, the increased amount of money being sent back to Mexico is helping its economy greatly as people now have money to spend on goods and services.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As people move out of Mexico, pressure on land, social services and jobs is being relieved. Unemployment will fall and health services will no longer be over capacity as the population is reduced. The problem, however, arises when the young and skilled workforce leaves, resulting in a shortage of potential workers to fill these newly freed jobs and to work in these social services. A shortage of medically trained people, for example, could counteract the relieved health system. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mexico’s population is very dependent on food grown in Mexico. Unfortunately, the majority of migrants come from rural areas, leaving a shortage of farmers and therefore the potential for food shortages in Mexico as the economically active people from rural areas leave. </p>

<h2 id="why-do-people-migrate">Why Do People Migrate?</h2>

<ul>
  <li>For economical, environmental, sociocultural or political reasons. </li>
  <li>Migration can be voluntary or forced, temporary or permanent, national or international. </li>
  <li>Population movements are driven and sustained by potential push and pull forces due to an imbalance in economic activities and opportunities. </li>
  <li>Push factors are features of the home area which creates pressure and so causes people to move away. e.g. persecution, unemployment &amp; poverty.</li>
  <li>Pull factors operate at places outside of the migrant’s home area to attract individuals to a new location. e.g. political asylum, a promotion, high living standards in another area.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="economic-impacts">Economic Impacts</h3>

<h4 id="positive">Positive</h4>

<ul>
  <li>The area benefits from remittences sent home. </li>
  <li>Upon return, migrants bring new skills to the country such as the ability to speak foreign languages.These new skills can help to improve the economy in the country of origin. </li>
  <li>There is less pressure on resources such as food and social services such as health care. </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="negative">Negative</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Loss of young workforce; those with skills and those with entrepreneurial talents move, slowing economic development. </li>

  <li>Returning migrants increase social expectations for communities, for example, increasing demand for better leisure facilities. </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="negatives">Negatives</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Marriage rates fall and family structures break down as men migrate producing a generation of single mums. </li>
  <li>Lots of young people migrating out of the country can increase the dependency ratio. </li>
  <li>Returning retired migrants may increase social costs on the community as support mechanisms aren’t in place for them. </li>
  <li>Migration of men and young families can cause a loss of cultural leadership and traditions. </li>

<ul>
  <li>Migrants take up less desirable, menial jobs which natives would not take but need filling. </li>
  <li>The host country can gain skilled labour for cheap. </li>
  <li>There is a labour surplus; those with skills and education fuel the economy. </li>

<ul>
  <li>Migrant children must be educated, they won’t necessarily speak the native language of the host country. </li>
  <li>There is an over dependency in some industries on migrant labour, leading to a lack of jobs for people native to the host country. </li>
  <li>Much of the money earned by the migrants isn’t spent in the host country and is instead sent back to the country of origin. </li>
  <li>More people increase the pressure on resources  and services such as health care systems. </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="social-impacts-1">Social Impacts</h3>

<h4 id="positive-2">Positive</h4>

<h2 id="essay">Essay</h2>

<hr />

<p>Below is an essay I wrote discussing the situtation regarding France’s population, the pro natalist policy in detail and evaluating how effective the policy has been. I was graded an A for it, the only criticsm being that the fifth paragraph didn’t specifically relate to the pro natalist policy. Don’t be lazy. <strong>Don’t copy this</strong>.</p>

<p>France’s population is entering an increasingly critical state due to a rapidly decreasing support ratio, a low fertility rate and a falling birth rate. An increasing proportion of France’s population is now over the age of 60, whilst there are fewer economically active people and even fewer people having children. This presents an economic problem as the economically active people must pay taxes towards the pensions of the older population and towards social care, which helps care for the elderly. With less young people in work, there’s less money funding the elderly which will, eventually, lead to a decline in the standard of care which the elderly can receive, simply due to a lack of funds. Currently, over 21% of France’s population is over 60 and it’s predicted that by 2050, ⅓ of the population will be over 60.  The economic impacts of this low support ratio are huge. It’s currently costing the French government €12.9 billion to pay for the social security &amp; health care of the elderly due to the large proportion of old people to employed young people. Since 1901, the support ratio of France has fallen a large amount. In 1901, the support ratio was 7.8 persons aged 15-64 to one person aged 65 years or older. In 1950, this number had fallen to 5.8, largely as a side effect of the two world wars. By 1995, the ratio had fallen to just 4.4 young people to one old person.</p>

<p>In addition to the rapidly decreasing support ratio, France’s population also faces the problem of a falling birth rate &amp; low total fertility rate. The fertility rate of France in 1960 was 2.75 children per woman, well above the replacement level of 2.1. However by 1992 the total fertility rate had fallen to 1.67, substantially lower than the replacement level. This low fertility rate is due to an increasing proportion of educated women who are pursuing careers. Today, 81% of women in France are employed. Women are now focusing on their careers rather than on raising families, resulting in women putting off having children until they’re 30 or deciding to just not have children, especially middle class women. This has the effect of lowering both the fertility rate and the birth rate to levels below replacement level, resulting in smaller successive generations. This, combined with an ageing population, presents the problem of a low number of economically active individuals in the future, resulting in a decreased support ratio and raising costs to care for the elderly which ultimately increases the strain on France’s treasury.</p>

<p>In order to combat the falling fertility rate, France has employed an aggressive pro-natalist policy which employs a system of monetary incentives and rewards for women giving birth to multiple children which seems to have helped raise France’s total fertility rate to 1.98, the second highest in Europe next to Ireland, but still below replacement level. In 1939, the French government passed the “Code de la famille”, a complex legislation that introduced a set of pro-natalist policies in order to attempt to improve France’s flailing fertility rate. One of the key aspects of the legislation was a series of incentives offered to working women, in order to encourage them to have children. The legislation introduced a long maternity period of 20 weeks to 40 weeks depending on the number of children the woman has already given birth to. In addition to the long maternity leave, women also receive full pay during the maternity period, the idea of which is to ensure that women don’t lose out on their careers should they have children. In addition to fully payed maternity leave, the legislation also introduced a series of generous grants to women having children, especially multiple children. When a women has her third child, the French government will pay her up to €1,000 per month, depending on how well off she already is, as a reward. This is just €200 less than the French minimum wage. This, combined with next to free public transport (families are given a “large family card”, halving metro costs), €174 a year for extra-curricular activities and free entrance to public swimming pools and other public facilities, essentially means that the poorest families in France can raise a child for virtually nothing and the most well off can raise one for around €500.</p>

<p>In addition to grants and discounts on public services, the French government also offers subsidised state run childcare for children of 3 months, again, ensuring that women can continue to work after giving birth with minimal financial penalties. The level of subsidisation works on a scale of €0 to €500 a month, again, depending on the family’s income. Families also receive full tax subsidisation until the youngest child reaches 18, further reducing the financial impact of having multiple children. Finally, for when women reach retirement age, the French government offers full pension schemes for mothers of multiple of children. </p>

<p>Recently, the French government announced plans to raise the retirement age from 60 to 62 (by 2018) in an attempt to increase the support ratio by reducing the number of people who are classed as elderly. In addition to the increased retirement age, people will need to work 41.5 years in 2020 to claim a full pension versus the 40.5 years they must work now. </p>

<p>The code de la famille has evolved a lot since it was initially introduced in 1939 and continues to do so today in order to further improve the fertility rate. In 1967, for example, an aspect of the legislation which banned the sale of contraceptives was removed, likely due to contraceptives’ effectiveness at stopping the spread of STDs. </p>

<p>The critical questions regarding the code de la famille is if it has been successful so far and if it will continue to be successful in the future. The legislation is costing the French government <em>massive</em> amounts of money to fund, which is increasing the strain on the treasury further. If the legislation was to fail, it could bankrupt the country. Opinions on the success of the policy vary wildly. The pro-natalist policy is politically neutral and all parties of the French government support it and most will call it a success. The ex-Prime Minister, Dominique de Villepin claims that baby booms and immigration will help to make “France the most populous country in Europe by 2030.” Despite the optimistic approach, he provides no evidence to support his claim. The UN estimates that France’s population will be 69.2 million by 2030 (it’s currently 64.8 million people) and 69.8 million by 2050. Germany’s, on the other hand, is estimated to be 77.9 million by 2030, casting doubt on the ex-Prime Minister’s statement. This is significantly below the French government’s goal of 75 million which suggests that, at the moment, the pro-natalist policy is not going to have the desired effects. There are currently no predictions available for the total fertility rate however given it’s current trend of increasing, it could surpass replacement level by 2050 assuming there are no unexpected events such as wars or famines. </p>

<p>Looking at data currently available regarding France’s population, the code de la famille would hint at success. Frances fertility rate has risen from 1.67 in 1992 to 1.98 today and, whilst this is still below replacement level, it indicates that the code de la famille is raising the fertility rate as desired. However, the cost of this pro-natalist policy is diminishing its success. Given France’s current budget deficit of 7.5% its GDP and the current situation regarding the euro, the country could struggle to fund the pro-natalist policies in the near future, which could limit its success and ultimately result in the policy failing, worsening the issue of paying for the elderly’s social care. </p>

<p>There is evidence to suggest that some of the improvement in Frances fertility rate is due to immigration and not due to the pro-natalist policy. When immigrants arrive in France, they are generally young and of child bearing age which could be causing the improved fertility rate instead of the pro-natalist policies. However, France’s net migration rate is only 1.46 migrants per 1,000 of the population which wouldn’t be high enough to effect the total fertility rate to the extent it has been. </p>

<p>Overall, the success of the policy is debatable. The policy is costing the government billions of euros on top of what it is costing the government to support the ageing population. The UN is predicting that the population will not increase to the desired amount and analysts predict that France will not be able to raise the fertility rate above the replacement level. The French government, on the other hand, argues that they will reach their goal of 75 million by 2050 using data collected by the itself. It’s difficult to tell whether the French government’s data is truthful however as, if the pro-natalist policy is not working, it could be damaging to the government’s integrity revealing this. Judging by the available data though and the predictions put forward by the UN, it would seem that the policy is going to receive little success. The population will only increase by 0.6 million between 2030 and 2050 and the fertility rate is not expected to exceed the replacement level. This, combined with the high cost makes the population seem relatively unsuccessful in the long run. </p>

  <li>It will be raised to 68 between 2024 and 2046.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="grey-vote">“Grey Vote”</h4>

<p>The voting power of old people will increase and the needs of the elderly can’t be ignored by politicians. </p>

<h4 id="grey-pound">“Grey Pound”</h4>

<p>Economic purchasing power is also increasing and is beneficial to companies providing specialist goods and services to the elderly.</p>

<h3 id="ageing--housing">Ageing &amp; Housing</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Segregation based on age can be seen in a number of ways in UK towns and cities. Some council estates include purpose build bungalows or maisonettes with security access allowing the elderly to live in the community as long as they are able to.</li>
  <li>Sheltered accommodation is a complex of flats or units with some shared facilities overseen by a warden or manager. </li>
  <li>Nursing homes have increased in number to cater for the elderly who have difficulty looking after themselves. They are often found in both inner and outer suburbs.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="youthful-populations">Youthful Populations</h3>

<p>Population pyramids of youthful populations have wide bases indicating a high fertility rate and a large proportion of youthful people. The pyramid has a tapering top indicating either, a) a high mortality rate or b) a large amount of outwards migration. The pyramid has a narrow apex showing that there is a small proportion of elderly people.</p>

<h3 id="how-does-iran-reflect-this">How Does Iran Reflect This?</h3>

<p>Iran has a narrowing apex, with few people living in the country being older than 80, suggesting a high death rate or high outwards migration rate. Iran’s population pyramid also has a wide base showing that there is a large number of youths however this has narrowed over the years showing a reduction in the number of youths. This could potentially be due to the outwards migration of young, fertile couples, due to changes in the social perception of large families or due to changes in health care in Iran. </p>

                <content type="html"><![CDATA[ <p>It’s becoming increasingly important for councils and governments to start managing coastlines in order to protect them from increasing <a href="/coasts/coastal-erosion/">coastal erosion</a> and flooding due to altering <a href="/coasts/sea-level-change/">sea levels</a>. The reason for coastal management is obvious, to protect homes and businesses from being damaged and even destroyed by coastal erosion or flooding. Failure to do so can have severe economic and social effects, especially along coastlines which are used for tourism and industry (pretty much all of them).</p>

<p>Management of coastlines is also important to help protect natural habitats, however governments generally don’t engage in coastal management where there isn’t an economic risk as effective coastal management is <em>very</em> expensive.</p>

<p>When engaging in coastal management, there’s four key approaches that can betaken:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Hold the line - Where existing coastal defences are maintained but no new defences are set up.</li>
  <li>Advance the line - New defences are built further out in the sea in an attempt to reduce the stress on current defences and <em>possibly</em> extend the coastline slightly. </li>
  <li>Retreat the line (surrender) - Move people out of danger zones and let mother nature unleash take control.</li>
  <li>Do nothing - The easy option, deal with the effects of flooding and erosion as they come or just ignore them. This is generally what happens in areas where there’s no people, and so nothing of “value” (to the government) to protect. </li>
</ol>

<p>Like most engineering schemes in geography, there’s hard and soft coastal engineering. As usual, hard engineering techniques are high technology, high cost, human made solutions. They do little to work with nature and sustainability is a key issue with them, despite their initial signs of success. Soft engineering techniques are low tech, low cost solutions that work with nature to reduce erosion. They’re no where near as effective as hard engineering techniques but they’re far more sustainable. </p>

<h2 id="hard-engineering-techniques">Hard Engineering Techniques</h2>

<h3 id="sea-walls">Sea Walls</h3>

<p>These are the most obvious defensive methods. Sea walls are exactly that. Giant walls that span entire coastlines and attempt to reduce erosion and prevent flooding in the process. They’re big, ugly and very expensive requiring constant maintenance so that they don’t fail. They also produce a strong backwash in waves which undercuts the sea wall making their long term sustainability questionable. </p>

<p>Traditionally, sea walls are large flat walls however more modern sea walls have a curved structure that reflects waves back into incoming waves, breaking them up and further reducing erosion. </p>

<h3 id="groynes">Groynes</h3>

<p>Groynes are relatively soft hard engineering techniques. They’re low lying wooden walls that extend out to sea. The idea of groynes is to capture sand that moves down the beach via longshore drift and help build up a larger section of beach in front of an area that’s experiencing coastal erosion. The new beach will increase the distance that waves have to travel to reach the coast and, in the process, they’ll lose most of their energy, reducing their impact. Groynes are pretty effective but they have one major drawback. Groynes will remove a lot of the sand that’s present down-drift of the beach which will result in a thinner beach at this area. This, in turn, means that sections of the coast will be more exposed to erosion down drift of the groynes which can create new problems relating to coastal management. </p>

<h3 id="gabions">Gabions</h3>

<p>Gabions are quite simply bundles of rocks in a metal mesh. They’re placed at the base of a cliff in an attempt to reduce the impact of waves on the cliff and prevent the cliff from being undercut. They’re not particularly effective and they’re quite unsightly but they’re sure as hell cheap. </p>

<h3 id="revetments">Revetments</h3>

<p>Revetments are concrete (or in some cases wooden) structures that are built along the base of a cliff. They’re slanted and act as a barrier against waves not too dissimilar to a sea wall.  The revetments absorb the energy of the waves, preventing the cliffs from being eroded. Revetments can be modified so that they have rippled surfaces, which further help to dissipate the wave energy. Revetments are normally successful at reducing coastal erosion but they are expensive to build. Once built however, they don’t require as much maintenance as a sea wall.</p>

<h3 id="riprap">Riprap</h3>

<p>Riprap are just rocks and stones that have been put against the base of a cliff. They’re similar to gabions in their purpose but they aren’t bound together in a mesh. This makes them look slightly more appealing as they blend into the environment better however the rocks are susceptible to being moved by the sea. </p>

<h3 id="breakwaters">Breakwaters</h3>

<p>Breakwaters are offshore concrete walls that break incoming waves out at sea so that their erosive power is reduced to next to none when they reach the coast. Breakwaters are effective but they can be easily destroyed during a storm and they don’t look particularly nice. </p>

<h3 id="tidal-barriers">Tidal barriers</h3>

<p>Big, retractible walls built across estuaries that can be used as a floodgate to prevent storm surges. They’re hugely effective but they’re also hugely expensive. </p>

<h2 id="soft-engineering-techniques">Soft Engineering Techniques</h2>

<h3 id="beach-nourishment">Beach Nourishment</h3>

<p>This is where sand and shingle are added to a beach in order to make it wider. This increases the distance a wave has to travel to reach the cliffs and so the wave will lose more energy and have less erosive power when it reaches the cliffs. The sand and shingle has to be obtained from elsewhere and is normally obtained from dredging.</p>

<h3 id="land-management">Land Management</h3>

<p>Land management is often used to help protect and rebuild dunes. Sand dunes act as a good barrier against coastal flooding and erosion and they can be exploited as a natural defence against the sea. In order to do so though, the dunes must be left relatively undisturbed so boardwalks are constructed and sections of sand dune systems are marked as out of bounds to the general public in order to reduce the erosion of the dunes by humans. This land management is discussed in more detail <a href="/coasts/features-of-deposition/#sandDuneProtection">here</a>.</p>

<h3 id="marshland-creation">Marshland Creation</h3>

<p>Marshland can be used to break up the waves and reduce their speed, reducing the waves erosive power. The marshlands also limit the area which waves can reach preventing flooding. The marshlands can be created by encouraging the growth of marshland vegetation such as glassworts. </p>

<h3 id="beach-stabilisation">Beach Stabilisation</h3>

<p>The goal of beach stabilisation is the same as beach nourishment’s goal, to widen the beach and dissipate as much wave energy as possible before it reaches the cliffs. Beach stabilisation involves planting dead trees in the sand to stabilise it and lower the profile of the beach while widening the beach too. </p>

<h2 id="case-study">Case Study</h2>

<h3 id="location">Location</h3>

<p>The Wirral is located in the north west of England, to the south of Liverpool. The Wirral is a <em>peninsula</em> meaning that three sides of the Wirral are surrounded by water while the fourth side is attached to the land. To the west of the Wirral is the Irish sea, to the north is the River Mersey and to the south is the River Dee. The Wirral did, and continues to in some areas, serve as an important port for the United Kingdom and today, sections of the Wirral’s coastline are used as reasonably popular tourist destinations. On differing sections of the Wirral’s coastline, different types of coastal defences have been employed in an attempt to reduce the impacts of coastal erosion on the coast. A combination of both hard engineering and soft engineering techniques have been employed. </p>

<h3 id="hard-engineering-in-new-brighton">Hard Engineering In New Brighton</h3>

<p>New Brighton was a very important coastal tourist destination on the Wirral however over the past 30 years the are has fallen into decline. In more recent years, the area has been rejuvenated and many new structures have been constructed along New Brighton making protecting New Brighton from the sea incredibly important. Land uses in New Brighton include economic and residential uses. In recent years a new theatre has been constructed in New Brighton known as the “Floral Pavilion”. This venue is of particular importance to New Brighton as it is the primary source of visitors to the area and has received much recognition including a visit from The Queen. </p>

<p>New Brighton is at particular risk of coastal flooding and erosion due to its location. Located on the North West tip of Wirral, New Brighton receives a pounding from the sea. Waves that impact New Brighton are very energetic as they’ve got a strong fetch from the approximately 200km of water (the Irish Sea) that the New Brighton coast faces. In addition, a low pressure system around New Brighton means that storm surges are a common occurrence making the area particularly susceptible to flooding. This is worsened by the fact that most of New Brighton is only a few metres above sea level so only a relatively small storm surge would be needed to flood a large section of New Brighton. </p>

<p>In order to protect New Brighton, several sea defences have been employed. In order to protect against both coastal erosion and flooding, a large sea wall was constructed in the 1930s, known as the King’s Parade Sea Wall. The wall is 4m tall and stretches along 2.3km of coastline. It was constructed using leftover material from the construction of the Queensway tunnel. The wall is specially designed in order to reduce the impact of waves as much as possible and increase its lifespan at the same time. The top of the wall is curved slightly in order to reflect back waves that impact it and dissipate their energy. This helps reduce the rate at which the sea wall is worn down since it is, slowly, being worn away. This is one of the main issues with the wall, it requires a lot of attention and is expensive.</p>

</figcaption>

<p>The King’s Parade Sea Wall.</p>

<p>It has, however, been very effective at preventing both coastal erosion and flooding. The wall has produced 100m of ‘new’ land. In reality, this is land that was submerged by the sea but is no longer submerged since the sea can’t access it any more. In addition to this reclaimed land, there have been no cases of cliff collapse in many years and there have been no major floods either, suggesting that the wall is effective at preventing flooding. </p>

<p>In tandem with the sea wall, coastal zoning has taken place along New Brighton in an attempt to reduce the risk of flooding should the sea wall. The aforementioned 100m of reclaimed land is almost completely undeveloped, with the exception of a few parks, since it’s <em>very</em> low lying land and should the sea wall be breached it would be flooded very rapidly. Pretty much all residential developments are placed on top of the relic cliffs so that they have a little bit of protection in the event of a flood. </p>

<h3 id="soft-engineering---thursaston">Soft Engineering - Thursaston</h3>

<p>Thursaston is located on the opposite side of the Wirral and is the exact opposite to New Brighton in terms of development and importance (to some people). Thursaston has very little in terms of human developments. The area is in fact a SSSI (Site of Special Scientific Interest) and is mostly just plants and wildlife with some interesting sandstone landforms. Given that Thursaston lacks human development, little has been done to prevent coastal erosion here. What has been done, though, is all soft engineering. </p>

<p>The cliffs along Thursaston are very susceptible to erosion despite the fact that the waves washing ashore are relatively weak constructive waves. The reason for their susceptibility is their composition. They’re primarily weak sandstone and boulder clay and the <a href="/coasts/coastal-erosion/#dip">bedding layers</a> of the cliffs dip towards the sea, so they’re not particularly stable. The cliffs are also susceptible to sub-aerial weathering and mass movements are frequently take place along them. </p>

<p>Given the low-value land that lies behind these cliffs, the local council and environmental agency has done little in terms of trying to protect these cliffs and what has been done wasn’t particularly effective. </p>

<p>Gabions were placed around the bases of the cliffs and can still be found there today. The idea was to reduce undercutting of the cliffs by the sea but they haven’t been all too successful since the cliffs are still collapsing today. Now days, the main benefit of the gabions is that they provide a (small) habitat for several species of plant and insect, that’s about it. The plants that have colonised the gabions help to make the gabions appear to blend into the environment a bit better too. </p>

<p>Another soft engineering technique that was employed was the introduction of drainage pipes into the cliffs. Given that the cliffs are made of boulder clay, if they became saturated with water they’d become lubricated quickly and mass movements would begin to take place. The drainage pipe was supposed to remove water from the cliffs stopping them from becoming saturated but it has proved to be totally ineffective. This is evident from the fact that a severed pipe bound in concrete can be found just lying on the beach. The cliff collapsed and the pipe fell out and was left on the beach. This is a testimony to both the effectiveness of the pipe and how much the council cares about the cliffs.</p>

<figcaption>
	<img src="/Images/coasts/10coastalManagement/failPipe.jpeg" alt="A drainage pip that has been unsuscesful in preventing cliff collapse." />
	<p>The 'Fail Pipe'</p>
</figcaption>

<p>The cliffs are likely to continue collapsing at Thursaston however there is one thing that may save them. A salt marsh appears to be developing before the cliffs and, with a little help from some humans, could be enough to stop the cliffs from collapsing. Unfortunately nobody is helping the marsh to develop and people are going around and removing many of the plants that are growing there as if a salt marsh was to develop, it would prove to be a problem for the sailing groups located nearby.</p>

<p>Low birth rate, low death rate, rising dependency ratio. Long life expectancy. </p>

<p>Migration can affect the structure of populations greatly. Internal migration within a country from rural areas to urban areas will significantly alter the number of young people aged 20-30 living in an area. In rural areas this number will decrease as young people move out of them to cities to find work. Conversely in cities the number will increase as the people from the rural areas enter the city. On a population pyramid this will result in a bulge in the population of middle aged people in cities. </p>

<p>Migration into a country will also alter the country’s population structure. The majority of people who migrate will be young males so this will result in an increase in the number of young males in the host country. This will also result in a decrease in the number of young males in the country of origin and, on a long time scale, the total number of males older than 18. A side effect of migration on the host country is that it will increase the number of young children too as the people who migrate into the country will be of fertile age and are likely to have children in the new country. The overall effect of this on the host country’s population pyramid is two bulges, one for young children and one for young men. </p>

<h3 id="the-dependency-ratio">The Dependency Ratio</h3>

<p>The dependency ratio shows how reliant young and old people are on the economically active population. A higher dependency ration indicates that more of the population is reliant on the working population. The ratio and can be expressed as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Dependency Ratio = Young Population (0 - 14) + Old Population (65+) / Population Aged 15-64</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="the-support-ratio">The Support Ratio</h3>

<p>The juvenile index indicates the proportion of young people to old people. The greater the index, the more young people there are. </p>

                <content type="html"><![CDATA[ <h2 id="causes-of-coastal-flooding">Causes of Coastal Flooding</h2>

<h3 id="storm-surges">Storm Surges</h3>

<p>Storm surges are sudden rises in sea level caused by very strong winds, normally those found in hurricanes and cyclones. The strong winds essentially push the water on an ocean’s surface on top of more water, increasing the sea level and flooding coastlines. The conditions needed to create these strong winds are generally associated with low pressures, further increasing the sea level. The strong winds can create large and powerful waves that can overtop coastal defences so even if the rise in sea level doesn’t flood the coastline, the resulting waves likely will.</p>

<p>Logically, storm surges are most dangerous during <a href="/coasts/tides/">high tides</a>, since the sea level will already be elevated at this time. </p>

<h3 id="rising-sea-levels">Rising Sea Levels</h3>

<p><em>Sea level rise is discussed in more detail <a href="/coasts/sea-level-change/">here</a></em>.</p>

<p>As sea levels rise due to climate change or isostatic rebound low lying coastal areas are permanently flooded by the sea. The likelihood and severity of storm surges also rises since weaker winds will also be able to increase the sea level enough to flood coastal areas. </p>

<h3 id="tsunamis">Tsunamis</h3>

<p>Tsunamis are giant waves resulting from earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, meteor impacts, any sort of major displacement of water in the ocean. Tsunamis are incredibly dangerous since they travel quickly and are difficult to detect. Out at sea, close to the source of the tsunami, the amplitude of the wave is relatively low making it difficult to detect but it travels very quickly (over 800kmh<sup>-1</sup>). As it approaches the shore the wave slows down significantly but its amplitude increases exponentially without the wave breaking. When the wave hits the coast it does so with an immense amount of energy and its amplitude continues to grow as it slows down even more. Tsunamis have so much energy that they can travel several miles inland.</p>

<p>Tsunamis flood vast expanses of land and cause immense amounts of damage due to the energy they impact the coast with and the fact that they collect debris as they inundate more areas. </p>

<h3 id="reclaimed-land">Reclaimed Land</h3>

<p>Many coastal settlements have developed onto what is known as “reclaimed land”. This is land that has been gained from the sea due to <a href="/coasts/coastal-management/">coastal management</a> or, somewhat ironically, lowered sea levels. This land, while highly valuable, is low lying and flat, so a small rise in sea level from a mild storm surge is enough to flood it and cause extensive damage.</p>

<h2 id="march-2011-thoku-earthquake--tsunami-japan">March 2011 Tōhoku Earthquake &amp; Tsunami (Japan)</h2>

<p>On March 11<sup>th</sup> 2011, a magnitude<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup> 9.0 earthquake occurred with an epicentre that was around 70km from the Tōhoku region<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">2</a></sup> of Japan. The earthquake displaced water in the Pacific Ocean by nearly 6m creating an incredibly powerful tsunami that devastated the eastern coastline of Japan. The first wave of the tsunami took around an hour to reach the coastline and flooded Sendai airport. From this point, several waves impacted the coast with heights ranging from 3m to 20m in different areas around Japan. The height of the waves was predicted to be between 3m to 6m. In the city of Sendai, the tsunami flooded land 10km away from the coast.</p>

<h3 id="social-impacts">Social Impacts</h3>

<ul>
  <li>The tsunami killed thousands of people. The National Police Agency has stated that the death toll from the earthquake was 15,870 deaths of which 14,308 people drowned. Many more people are still missing. In the town of Minamisanriku, 10,000 people went missing.</li>
  <li>The tsunami wiped entire towns off the map, destroying communities and uprooting &amp; separating families. Out of 100,000 children who were forced out of their homes, many of them were separate from their parents. </li>
  <li>Because of the large number of people killed, mass graves had to be dug for the dead as morgues and crematoriums were over capacity and damaged. With no where to preserve bodies, they had to be buried before disease started to spread. </li>
  <li>Over 700 cultural relics were destroyed by the tsunami and many museums and libraries were flooded.</li>
  <li>A level 7<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote">3</a></sup> nuclear meltdown at the Fukushima Daiichi power plant resulting from the tsunami forced 1700 people to evacuate their homes in the area surrounding the accident. They will not be able to return to their homes for a long time since they have been contaminated with radioactive materials. </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="economic-impacts">Economic Impacts</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Through a combination of the tsunami and earthquake (with the tsunami doing most of the damage) 45,000 buildings were destroyed and 145,000 were damaged. The estimated cost of the disaster is in the tens of billions of dollars. </li>
  <li>Industry was heavily disrupted due to power cut outs caused by the loss of a power plant, the severing of electrical pylons and the loss of oil due to a fire at an oil refinery. </li>
  <li>Some of the worst affected areas by the tsunami were ports and fishing villages. 319 ports were damaged by the tsunami and had to be closed some for up to a year. The tsunami caused some ¥1.3 trillion in damage to the fishing industry in the areas affected by the tsunami. </li>
  <li>Most people who owned homes did not have earthquake or tsunami insurance and so will have to pay for repairs or reconstruction of their homes themselves or through government assistance. </li>
  <li>24,000Ha of farmland was destroyed by tsunami. The presence of salt on this farmland will make it un-farmable for many years now. </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="environmental-impacts">Environmental Impacts</h3>

<ul>
  <li>The tsunami washed tonnes of debris out to sea including wooden planks, metal, cars, boats and oil. Debris has been found on coasts around the globe and pose risks to sea life and animals that live along coasts. </li>
  <li>The nuclear meltdown at the Fukushima Daiichi power plant has released unknown but dangerous amounts of radioactive material into the atmosphere and water nearby the power plant. Food that was grown in Fukushima has now been banned because it was found to contain high levels of radiation.  </li>
  <li>The meltdown will have environmental impacts globally since the radioactive materials have entered the atmosphere. </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="responses">Responses</h3>

<ul>
  <li>In the immediate aftermath of the earthquake, a tsunami warning was broadcast that allowed people to get to higher ground. The tsunamis were taller than predicted though and many of the safe zones weren’t safe. </li>
  <li>Urban search and rescue teams and the Japan Self Defence Force carried out search and rescue operations in the areas affected by the tsunami and earthquake. </li>
  <li>The Japanese government requested assistance from South Korea, New Zealand, Australia, Germany, the USA and the UK and also made satellite data, showing the extensive damage caused by the tsunami, available to all relief efforts.</li>

                <content type="html"><![CDATA[ <p>The sea level has and continues to fluctuate greatly throughout time. On a day to day basis, the sea level changes according to the <a href="/coasts/tides/">tide</a> but the sea level also changes on a much grander time scale too. These changes in sea level are normally caused by ice ages or other major global events.</p>

<p>The sea level changes for a variety of reasons. These reasons can be put into two categories, eustatic and isostatic change, depending on if they have a global effect on sea level or a local effect on the sea level.</p>

<h2 id="eustatic-change">Eustatic Change</h2>

<p>Eustatic change is when the sea level changes due to an alteration in the volume of water in the oceans or, alternatively, a change in the shape of an ocean basin and hence a change in the amount of water the sea can hold. Eustatic change is <strong>always</strong> a global effect. </p>

<p>During and after an ice age, eustatic change takes place. At the beginning of an ice age, the temperature falls and water is frozen and stored in glaciers inland, suspending the hydrological cycle. This results in water being taken out of the sea but not being put back in leading to an overall fall in sea level. Conversely, as an ice age ends, the temperature begins to rise and so the water stored in the glaciers will reenter the hydrological cycle and the sea will be replenished, increasing the sea levels. </p>

<p>Increases in temperature outside of an ice age will also effect the sea level since an increasing temperature will cause the ice sheets to melt, putting more water in the sea. </p>

<p>The shape of the ocean basins can change due to tectonic movement. If the ocean basins become larger, the volume of the oceans becomes larger but the overall sea level will fall since there’s the same amount of water in the ocean. Conversely, if the ocean basins get smaller, the volume of the oceans decreases and the sea level rises accordingly. </p>

<h2 id="isostatic-change">Isostatic Change</h2>

<p>Isostatic sea level change is the result of an increase or decrease in the height of the land. When the height of the land increases, the sea level falls and when the height of the land decreases the sea level rises. Isostatic change is a local sea level change whereas eustatic change is a global sea level change. </p>

<p>During an ice age, isostatic change is caused by the build up of ice on the land. As water is stored on the land in glaciers, the weight of the land increases and the land sinks slightly, causing the sea level to rise slightly. This is referred to as <em>compression</em>. When the ice melts at the end of an ice age, the land begins to rise up again and the sea level falls. This is referred to <em>decompression</em> or isostatic rebound. Isostatic rebound takes place incredibly slowly and to this day, isostatic rebounding is still taking place from the last ice age. </p>

<p>Isostatic sea level change can also be caused by tectonic uplift or depression. As this only takes place along plate boundaries, this sort of isostatic change only takes place in certain areas of the world. </p>

<h2 id="features-of-sea-level-change">Features of Sea Level Change</h2>

<p>Sea level change can produce many features along coastlines. Again, we can categorise these features based on how they’re formed.</p>

<h3 id="emergent-landforms">Emergent Landforms</h3>

<p>Emergent landforms begin to appear towards the end of an ice age and they occur when isostatic rebound takes place faster than a eustatic rise in sea level. Put more simply, the land’s height rises faster than the sea’s. Emergent features are features of coastal erosion that appear to have developed well above the current sea level. Really, they developed when the sea <em>was</em> at that level and then the sea level changed during and ice age and now they’re above sea level.</p>

<p>One such emergent landform is a <em>raised beach</em>. Raised beaches are wave-cut platforms &amp; beaches that are above the current sea level. You can normally find some old cliffs (relic cliffs) too behind these raised beaches with wave-cut notches, arches, stacks etc. along them. </p>

<p>These emergent features no longer experience coastal erosion but they are still weathered, often being weathered biologically, chemically and via freeze-thaw weathering.</p>

<h3 id="submergent-landforms">Submergent Landforms</h3>

<p>Submergent landforms are the opposite of emergent landforms. They form when the eustatic rise in sea level takes place faster than the isostatic rebound after an ice age. Basically, the water starts to flood the land and fills up landforms on the land.</p>

<p>One submergent feature is a <em>Ria</em>. This is a river valley that’s been flooded by the eustatic rise in sea level. They’re almost exactly like a typical river valley but they have even more water in them. The cross section of a ria is really similar to the one you’d find for a river in the lower course. One thing to note, the floodplain of the river also gets flooded, altering the cross profile of a ria ever so slightly so that it includes the floodplain.</p>

<p>Another submergent feature is a <em>Fjord</em>. These are steeper and deeper variants of riases that are relatively narrow for their size. They have a u-shaped cross profile and are often found in particularly icy sections of the world. Any guess what they could be? That’s right, they’re flooded glacial valleys (I’d only expect you to know that if you did “Ice on the land” for GCSE geography). In general, fjords are really deep however they have a shallow mouth (known as a <em>threshold</em>) as this is where the glacier deposited its load. Fjords are pretty stunning pieces of scenery, an example of one is Sogne Fjord in Norway which is <em>really</em> big.</p>

<p>The final submergent feature is a <em>dalmatian coastline</em>. These form in areas of the world where valleys (especially glacial valleys) lie parallel to each other. When the valleys are flooded by the rise in sea level, the tops of the valleys remain above the surface of the sea and appear to be a series of islands that run parallel to the coastline. The best example of a dalmatian coastline is the one from which they get their name, the Dalmatian coast in Croatia.</p>

<h2 id="the-future">The Future</h2>

<p>As we are constantly hearing, sea levels are still rising. The reasons are pretty widely debated. We know that one of the reasons is because we’re still coming out of our last ice age (amazingly, isostatic rebound is still taking place) and ice from the last ice age is still melting. <em>Most</em> of us also think that it’s because the planet’s getting hotter (<em>probably</em> because of us, but not for certain) which is melting even more ice on top of the ice that was already defrosting from the last ice age. Whatever the reason, the sea is rising and it’s a bit of a problem.</p>

<p>In the UK, the east coast is at a particularly high risk of a) being flooded and b) being destroyed. In fact, we know that sections of the east coast have already been destroyed and we’re fairly sure it’s because the sea is rising and the land is sinking. While the northern parts of the UK are experiencing an isostatic rebound and are rising above sea level, the east coast is sinking and the water along the east coast is rising. This is resulting in more coastal flooding and erosion along the east coast which is destroying it at a concerning rate. Obviously there’s a lot people living along the east coast but what’s more concerning is the fact that there’s a lot of power plants situated along the east coast and four of them are nuclear power plants (there’s also two deactivated nuclear plants). Even if we know that those plants are going to be destroyed by coastal erosion, there’s not a lot we can do to prevent an accident since these things stay dangerous for many thousands of years after they’re deactivated.</p>

                <content type="html"><![CDATA[ <p>The DTM describes how the population of a country changes over time. It shows changes in the birth rate and death rate of a country. The original model showed that countries passed through 4 stages however more recent versions of the model use 5 stages.</p>

<h3 id="advantages">Advantages</h3>

<ul>
  <li>It can be applied to all countries.</li>
  <li>It provides a starting point to demographic change over time.</li>
  <li>The timescales are flexible.</li>
  <li>It’s easy to understand.</li>
  <li>It enables comparisons between countries.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="disadvantages">Disadvantages</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Birth rates in several MEDCs have fallen below death rates. This has caused the population to decline which suggests that the model should have a fifth stage.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The DTM is Eurocentric as the model assumes that all countries pass through the same four stages. It now seems unlikely, however, that Africa and many other LEDCs will ever be industrialised. There are also variables and exceptions such as war that may lead to different results.  </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The model assumes the fall in death rate in stage 2 was due to industrialisation. In the UK, however, the death rate rose due to the poor conditions during the industrial revolution. The delayed fall in death rate in many LEDCs is due to the inability for people to afford healthcare. In many countries, the fall in birth rate has been slower in stage 3 due to opposition by religious organisations. Alternatively, in China, the birth rate has fallen sharply due to government intervention. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The timescale of the model, especially in several South-East Asian countries such as Hong Kong and Malaysia, is being squashed as they develop at a much faster rate than earlier industrialised countries. The UK stayed in stage 2 for over 100 years as social, economic and technological changes were introduced slowly and death rate fell slowly. In many LEDCs, death rate has fallen more rapidly because changes (i.e. the introduction of western medicine) have taken place much more quickly. The birth rate has stayed high and so the population has increased rapidly. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The model does not include the impacts of migration. Countries that grew as a consequence of emigration from Europe (E.g USA, Canada &amp; Australia) did not pass through the earlier stages of the model. </p>
  </li>
</ul>

                </author>
                <content type="html"><![CDATA[ <ul>
  <li><em>Crude death rate</em> - The average annual number of deaths a year per 1000 of the population.</li>
  <li><em>Age specific death rate</em> - This shows death rates per 1000 population by sex for age groups e.g. under 1, 1 - 4, 5 - 15 etc.</li>
  <li><em>Life Expectancy</em> - The average number of years to be lived by a group of people born in the same year, if mortality at each age remains constant in the future. </li>
  <li><em>Infant Mortality rate</em> - The number of deaths of children under the age of 1 per 1000 live births per year.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="patterns-of-global-death-rates">Patterns of Global Death Rates</h3>

<p>North America, Canada and South America show relatively low death rates. Mexico in particular shows very low death rates. Sub Saharan Africa on the other hand shows very high death rates whilst northern Africa shows lower, but still high, death rates. Most of Europe has a high death rate with Russia having a very high death rate. Afghanistan has an extremely high death rate too, whilst surrounding countries have much lower death rates. India has a surprisingly low death rate as does China. </p>

<h3 id="factors-effecting-mortality">Factors Effecting Mortality</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><em>Age distribution</em> - The higher the proportion of old people to young people, the higher the death rate since older people are more likely to die. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>Gender</em> - Women generally have a higher life expectancy than men, possibly due to the lifestyle or biological differences preventing certain diseases. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>Occupation</em> - In some countries people may be employed in dangerous occupations increasing the death rate e.g. Timber cutters in America with 105 deaths in 2000. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>Income</em> - Low income levels correlate to a low life expectancy whilst high income levels correlate with a high life expectancy. This is because a high income allows people to afford medical care, higher standards of living and healthier foods, prolonging their life. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>Literacy</em> - Areas with high literacy levels have higher life expectancies whereas areas with low literacy rates have low life expectancies. The reasoning behind this is that when people can read &amp; write, they can obtain higher paying jobs and therefore receive a higher income improving their life expectancy. In addition, when people can read they can read information on preventing the spread of disease and basic hygiene standards improving life expectancy. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>Access to food</em> - Countries with a lack of food have low life expectancies since the people suffer from malnutrition and are more susceptible to diseases due to a weakened immune system increasing the mortality rates. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>Medical Facilities</em> - Access to vaccination programs helps to prolong life expectancy and prevent the spread of diseases. Equipment such as mosquito nets also help prolong life expectancy. Access to medical clinics and doctors will also help to substantially lower the death rate. Access to and usage of these services is dependant on income and literacy rates however.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="factors-effecting-infant-mortality-rate">Factors Effecting Infant Mortality Rate</h3>

<h4 id="age-of-mother-birth-control-and-birth-interval">Age of Mother, Birth Control and Birth Interval</h4>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Younger mothers (less than 20 years) giving birth generally results in higher infant mortality rates. The same is true for older women (40 - 49 years).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By the 2nd and 3rd child, the infant mortality rate falls due to the women possessing more experience in caring for a child. After 3 children, the IMR begins to increase again as the family is less capable of looking after lots of children.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As mothers leave more time between successive babies, the infant mortality rate falls. For example, having a child within 2 years of a previous one results in a IMR of 110 however having a child within 4 years of another results in an IMR of 39. </p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="sex-of-infant">Sex of Infant</h4>

<p>Baby girls are more likely to die from neglect than boys due to the requirement of a boy for work, looking after parents, land etc in some countries. </p>

<h4 id="education-level-of-mother">Education Level of Mother</h4>

<p>Areas with high literacy rates generally have low IMRs since mothers are able for sad about child care, what to eat &amp; do during pregnancy and how to stay healthy. </p>

<h4 id="status-of-women-in-society">Status of Women In Society</h4>

<p>In some cultures, women are required to have children which results in a high IMR due to the increased frequency of births. In addition, in some countries, women aren’t able to see doctors, which can result in a substantially higher IMR. </p>

<h4 id="income">Income</h4>

<p>Countries with a high IMR generally have a low income and countries with a high income generally have a low IMR. Countries with more money have access to better sanitary healthcare, vaccinations and more nutritious food resulting in a reduced IMR. </p>

<h4 id="climate">Climate</h4>

<p>Equatorial areas with hot climates have higher IMRs due to droughts causing a shortage of food and water for the young. In addition, the hot climates increase the spread of disease again increasing the IMR.  </p>

<h4 id="geographical-location">Geographical Location</h4>

<p>The location of an area results in varying cultures, income levels etc. which alternates the IMR. </p>

                <id>/rivers/flood-management</id>
                <updated>2012-01-08T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

                <content type="html"><![CDATA[ <p>Rivers, especially big ones, can cause a lot of mayhem. When they flood, they destroy livelihoods, cause economic damage and kill people. It’s no surprise then that humans, being the clever creatures that we are, try and stop rivers from flooding using whatever resources we have. Unfortunately, rivers, like most things in nature, are powerful &amp; unpredictable. Stopping rivers from flooding full stop isn’t possible but we can do a lot to mitigate and manage the risks that arise from flooding.</p>

<p>Flood management strategies generally involve multiple engineering projects that can fall under one of two categories. <em>Hard engineering</em> projects are ones that involve the construction of artificial structures that, through a combination of science, technology and a bit of brute force, prevent a river from flooding. <em>Soft engineering</em> projects are the opposite. These projects use natural resources and local people’s knowledge of the river to reduce the risk posed by a flood.</p>

<p>Each type of project has its advantages and disadvantages. Hard engineering projects are generally very successful and have a large impact on the river. This is one of their downfalls though as the effects of a hard engineering project can disrupt ecological systems in the drainage basin. Hard engineering techniques generally involve the containment of large volumes of water so if they were to fail for some reason, the impacts could be many times worse than if the river had been allowed to flood naturally. There’s also the high cost, technological requirements &amp; maintenance of hard engineering projects that makes them unfeasible in countries without significant economic resources.</p>

<p>Soft engineering projects focus more on reducing the impacts of a flood rather than preventing one. The biggest advantage of soft engineering is cost. Soft engineering projects are significantly cheaper than hard engineering projects making them more suitable for less developed countries. They also have lower education &amp; technology requirements so they can be implemented by local people in remote parts of poor countries. </p>

<p>Soft engineering projects are more sustainable than their hard engineering counterparts. Soft engineering projects are low maintenance and low cost unlike hard engineering projects. In addition, they don’t disturb the natural processes and ecological systems in a river basin instead choosing to integrate with them and in some cases improve them.</p>

<h2 id="hard-engineering-techniques">Hard Engineering Techniques</h2>

<h3 id="dams">Dams</h3>

<p>Dams are the classic hard engineering solution to flooding problems. A dam is a giant wall built across a river’s channel to impede its flow. Water builds up behind the dam and forms a reservoir which can then be steadily drained at a controlled rate over time. This helps keep discharge downstream of the dam low even during prolonged heavy rainfall. </p>

<p>Besides being highly effective at reducing the risk of flooding, dams can also be used to generate hydroelectric power that can bring economic benefits to an area by attracting manufacturing factories or being exported to other countries. The reservoir that develops behind a dam can be used as a drinking source or for leisure activities. </p>

<p>Despite these benefits, dams have some damn big (so sorry) problems. Dams are among the most expensive of  all hard engineering techniques and require access to lots of raw materials like concrete and steel. They also have a huge impact on the local environment. The area behind a dam has to be flooded which destroys habitats and forces people out of their homes. Dams disrupt the processes that take place within a river too by, for example, preventing sediment from being transported downstream. This can result in landforms like <a href="/rivers/river-landforms/#deltas">deltas</a> being destroyed which can in turn result in the destruction of more habitats. When sediment gets trapped behind a dam, it can change the chemical composition of the water behind the dam which can kill aquatic animals living upstream.</p>

<p>Dams pose a huge risk too. They store thousands of litres of water behind them so if they were to fail, they’d cause widespread death and damage downstream as all the water is released at once.</p>

<h3 id="artificial-leves">(Artificial) Levées</h3>

<p>Artificial levées are, well, artificial versions of their <a href="/rivers/river-landforms/#levees">natural counterparts</a>. They act as embankments, essentially extending the channel’s height and increasing its bankfull discharge. Unlike natural levées, artificial levées are significantly larger and are generally constructed out of a material like concrete that is resistant to erosion. The main advantage of an artificial levée is that it allows the floodplain to be built on. This is their downfall though as they <em>encourage</em> the development of the floodplain which can increase the risk of flooding. Furthermore, if they did fail, like the embankments along the Mississippi did in 1927<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup>, the damage from the flood would be far worse than if the embankments didn’t exist.</p>

<h3 id="wing-dykes">Wing Dykes</h3>

<p>Wing dykes are slats that are placed in a river’s channel at ~90˚ to the banks. Generally they’ll be placed in pairs on either side of the channel with a gap between them that allows boats to pass through them. Behind dykes, sediment builds up and the channel is narrowed, forcing water to flow faster. This helps reduce the risk of flooding by getting water away from an area at risk of flooding as quickly as possible, preventing a build up of water. They also aid navigation greatly. While wing dykes reduce the risk of flooding in one area, downstream of a river they can increase the risk of flooding making them only useful in sparsely populated areas.</p>

<p><img src="/Images/rivers/wing-dykes.png" alt="A diagram of a wing dyke" /></p>

<h3 id="channel-straightening">Channel Straightening</h3>

<p>This technique kind of speaks for itself. By blocking off meanders and constructing alternate, straighter routes across meanders, the river starts to flow faster. Like with wing dykes, this moves water through the river faster preventing it from pooling and so reducing the risk of a flood. A straightened channel is faster to navigate too, a nice benefit of channel straightening. </p>

<p>Like with wing dykes, this technique has several problems. Downstream of a straightened section of a channel, flooding becomes more likely. In addition, erosion is stronger downstream because the river has a lot more kinetic energy. </p>

<h3 id="diversion-spillways">Diversion Spillways</h3>

<p>Diversion spillways are artificial channels that a river can flow into when its discharge rises. These channels move water around an area at risk of flooding and send it either back into the river (but further downstream) or into another river. Spillways generally have floodgates on them that can be used to control the volume of water in the spillway. </p>

<p>Spillways pose a threat to areas near the confluence between the spillway and whichever river it flows into as the discharge here will be increased and so too will the risk of flooding. In addition, the path that spillways take can take water around areas not usually used to flooding. If the spillway was to fail for some reason, this could cause widespread damage.</p>

<h2 id="soft-engineering-techniques">Soft Engineering Techniques</h2>

<h3 id="floodplain-zoning">Floodplain Zoning</h3>

<p>Floodplain zoning involves placing restrictions on land usage in the areas surrounding a river. Essentially, construction is unlimited outside of the floodplain but the floodplain itself is limited to the construction of public outdoor facilities like playing fields and parks. This has several effects in reducing the risk and impact of flooding. Obviously if no one is allowed to build on a floodplain then the damage caused by the river flooding will be greatly reduced because there isn’t much to damage. In addition, floodplain zoning ensures that land on the floodplain isn’t urbanised so infiltration can occur and surface run off is reduced. This reduces the likelihood of a river flooding. </p>

<p>The problem with floodplain zoning is that it limits development to certain areas. In addition, if a floodplain has already been developed on, there isn’t anything that can be done to un-develop it without forcing people off of the floodplain.</p>

<h3 id="afforestation">Afforestation</h3>

<p>Afforestation involves the planting of trees in a drainage basin to increase interception and storage while reducing surface run off. This reduces a river’s discharge and so makes it less likely to flood. Afforestation also prevents mass wasting which reduces the amount of soil entering the river and keeps the river’s capacity high. When combined with floodplain zoning, afforestation can be very effective at reducing the risk of flooding. </p>

<p>Afforestation has the benefit of creating new habitats for animals and improving water quality by filtering pollutants out of rainwater. The issue with afforestation is that it requires quite a lot of space to be effective and could prove unpopular among famers on the floodplain as they won’t be too happy with trees sapping nutrients from the soil. This issue can be combated somewhat by creating <em>riparian buffers</em>, thin vegetated strips of land that run adjacent to a river’s channel.</p>

<h3 id="wetland-restoration">Wetland Restoration</h3>

<p>Wetland restoration involves creating conditions that are favourable for the development of wetlands (marshes or swamps). Wetlands are able to store large volumes of water which helps to reduce the discharge in a river. Wetlands don’t reduce flooding where they are located but rather downstream of the river. They have the added benefit of creating new habitats for animals and greatly increasing biodiversity. They reduce the area of land available for farming though which makes them unpopular among farmers. </p>

<h3 id="river-restoration">River Restoration</h3>

<p>River restoration involves restoring a river that has undergone hard engineering back to its original course. This can involve un-straightening a channel, removing artificial levees, diversion spillways &amp; wing dykes. This may seem silly as it <em>is</em> going to reintroduce flooding back in the area where these structures were located but, if this land is no longer valuable, river restoration can help reduce the risk of flooding downstream. </p>

<p>River restoration is a good thing if it’s done properly as allowing the river to take its natural course prevents and reverts any environmental and ecological damage introduced by hard engineering projects. River restoration also has as good as 0 maintenance costs making it very cheap. </p>

<p>The issues arise when river restoration takes place in areas that are still being used by people. I said previously that river restoration can be used where land is no longer valuable. Well, what defines valuable? Farmland? A small village? A town? This decision comes down to the local environmental agency. If they make the wrong call, the restoration project can cause a lot of damage. </p>

<h2 id="hard-engineering---the-three-gorges-dam">Hard Engineering - The Three Gorges Dam</h2>

<p>The Three Gorges Dam is a mega-dam located on the Yangtze River in central China. It’s 2.3km wide, 185m high and took over 15 years to build. The dam was built in response to the seasonal flooding that takes place along the Yangtze that has killed hundreds of thousands of people. A flood in 1998 killed over 3,500 people, left 13M homeless and caused billions of dollars of damage. With several of China’s major economic cities (e.g. Nanjing) located along the Yangtze, it has become increasingly important for the Chinese government to do something to reduce the risk of flooding. </p>

<h3 id="impacts">Impacts</h3>

<h4 id="economic">Economic</h4>

<p>The overall cost of the dam is estimated at roughly ¥180 billion. It will take nearly a decade for the dam to pay for itself by generating electricity. The project was funded by the China Development Bank and profits from another dam located on the Yangtze. </p>

<p>Overall the dam will have a positive effect on China’s economy as the dam aids the navigability of the Yangtze by making it slower and deepening the channel. This will help increase the trade capacity of the river which acts as one of the largest transportation networks for trade within China. The dam will also reduce China’s dependency on coal meaning that it doesn’t have to spend as much on mining or importing coal.</p>

<p>The reduction in the risk of flooding will save money in the long run because there will be less economic damage in the future. The inundation of land behind the dam however is costly because many factories were located behind the dam and had to be relocated, often at a high cost. In addition, the lack of annual flooding means that much of the farmland that is located on the Yangtze’s floodplain will gradually become less fertile, reducing agricultural yield. </p>

<h4 id="social">Social</h4>

<p>The dam has succeeded in reducing the risk of flooding, taking the recurrence interval for large floods from 1 in 10 years to 1 in 100 years. Nonetheless, the Three Gorges Dam has had some huge negative social impacts. Over 1.2 million people were required to leave their homes as they were going to be inundated by the dam’s reservoir. The people who refused to leave were forcibly removed from their homes. The reservoir ended up flooding 13 cities and hundreds of villages. Those that were displaced were relocated to cities that had been specially constructed for the dam. </p>

<p>Many of those that were relocated lived on less than $1/day and were simple farmers who lacked any sort of skills. When they were moved to the new cities, they struggled to find work as there were relatively few agricultural jobs and they had no training for other sorts of jobs. This has exacerbated the poverty situation.</p>

<p>The land that was flooded was home to hundreds of cultural relics, archaeological sites and family burial grounds that date back to the Palaeolithic era. Some cultural sites, such as the Zhang Fei temple, were moved but many were not and there is thought to be hundreds of undiscovered archeological sites that have been destroyed. </p>

<p>The dam brought about few positive social impacts. Primarily, for many of the people living in poverty who were displaced, the new homes they were given represented a substantial step up in terms of quality and living standards.</p>

<h4 id="environmental">Environmental</h4>

<p>The Three Gorges Dam has already caused some environmental problems and is expected to continue to do so for the rest of its existence. The Yangtze transports a lot of sediment that is now being blocked behind the dam. Engineers have attempted to come up with a solution to this problem but it is unlikely to be as efficient as letting the sediment flow through. This is going to result in the gradual destruction of the Yangtze’s delta and increased erosion downstream of the dam. </p>

<p>The blocked sediment will alter the chemical composition of water upstream from the dam. This, in turn, will result in a reduction in biodiversity and the potential extinction of several species of animals. Given that the river is one of the main dumping grounds of industrial &amp; household waste, this wildlife threat will only grow larger. The waste will, like sediment, collect behind the dam, poisoning the water behind it.</p>

<p>The area of land that is becoming the dam’s reservoir was home to many species of endangered animals including the giant panda and the Chinese tiger. The destruction of their habitats only worsens their endangered status.</p>

<p>While the lack of annual flooding of the Yangtze is good, from an environmental perspective it is very bad as the farmers who relied on the fertile soil produced by floods will now have to use artificial fertiliser that will drain into the river and pollute the downstream section of the river. </p>

<p>There are some positive environmental impacts. The Three Gorges Dam serves as a hydroelectric power plant that has a capacity of ~22.5GW<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">2</a></sup>. This is enough to supply less than 5% of China’s power but that is still a considerable amount and will result in millions of tonnes of coal not being burnt. </p>

<h4 id="political">Political</h4>

<p>The forced relocation of 1.2 million people has raised numerous human rights concerns. Furthermore, the environmental impacts of the dam have created opposition from environmental groups and other governments. The World Bank refused to fund the project because of the environmental and social problems that were associated with the project. </p>

<p>The dam represents a major military target as downstream of the dam are some of China’s largest cities including Shanghai. If the dam were to be breached, it would cause <em>a lot</em> of damage and kill a lot of people. The dam is thought to be a potential target for terrorist organisations in Taiwan. </p>

<h2 id="soft-engineering---the-river-cole">Soft Engineering - The River Cole</h2>

<p>The River Cole is a tributary to the River Thames located in southern England. The River Cole has been heavily modified over 100s of years in order to improve its efficiency for milling. The channel had been straightened for milling and also widened &amp; dredged to reduce the risk of flooding. As a result of the alterations that took place, the quality of the water &amp; biodiversity in the area has fallen significantly. </p>

<p>In 1995, a project was set up to restore the River Cole to its original course. The project aimed to reintroduce wildlife to the area, improve the water quality and reduce the risk of flooding by reintroducing wetland. The project was funded by the EU, the River Restoration Centre (RRC), the Environmental Agency &amp; The National Trust.</p>

<p>In order to restore the original course of the River Cole, old maps of the channel were used to work out its natural course. To recreate the course, a new channel was created that flowed 1.2m above the current channel as the current channel had been dredged and was lower than the original. In addition, the new channel was given meanders that were present in the past and was given space to allow the river to meander naturally. Finally, the old channel was blocked off so that the river would flow through the newer channel. </p>

<p>The project appears to have been successful. It has recreated wetlands which will help reduce the risk of flooding and has also allowed the river to flood naturally, which will improve the fertility of the surrounding land and prevent floods further downstream. New wildlife and plants have started to inhabit the area surrounding the river and the surrounding environment is much more pleasant. </p>

<p>The project did receive some backlash. The floodplain surrounding the river is used as agricultural land and many farmers were unhappy to have marshland developing nearby. They also weren’t happy with the land that they would lose because of the new course the river would take and the fact that the river would meander and start to take up more land. Finally, they were unhappy with allowing the river to flood naturally as while it would deposit fertile alluvium, it would also inundate and damage anything they were growing at the time. </p>

                <content type="html"><![CDATA[ <p>Deposition occurs when accumulation of sediment exceeds removal. It usually takes place in a low energy environment. Landforms resulting from deposition include beaches, bars, tombolos, sand dunes &amp; salt marshes. </p>

<h2 id="spits">Spits</h2>

<p>A spit is a stretch of sand or shingle, attached to the mainland, that stretches into the sea. As material accumulates on a beach, it is transported along the beach via longshore drift in the direction of the prevailing wind. When the material reaches a river’s mouth, the (stronger) energy of the river prevents the sand from moving any further and it begins to accumulate. At this point, only the finest sediment can be transported out to sea. As the sand builds up, a spit forms, that extends out into the water but not beyond the river since the river will remove any sediment that crosses its path. The area behind the spit is a low energy environment since the spit provides shelter from the sea and, as a result of the low energy, a salt marsh begins to form behind the spit. </p>

<p>Often, spits will form around headlands that are close to river mouths since the headland provides shelter from the prevailing wind and helps create the lower energy environment necessary to build up a spit. As a result, wave refraction around the headland will push the spit in land, creating the distinctive curved shape of a spit. </p>

<p>The easiest way to demonstrate the formation of a spit is with a diagram.  </p>

<p><img src="/Images/coasts/8depositionalFeatures/spitFormationDiagram.png" alt="Diagram showing the formation of a spit." /></p>

<p>Spits are not permanent features. They are eroded, albeit slowly, by the sea and if a particularly large storm comes along, entire spits can be wiped out. As spits are created and destroyed, it can appear as if they are migrating and so the location and shape of spits is constantly changing. </p>

<p>Using Google Earth or Google Maps, it’s possible to see the shape of different spits from an aerial perspective. Try <a href="http://maps.google.com/?ll=53.60916,0.14170&amp;z=12&amp;t=h">Spurn Head</a> for a good example. Using Google Earth, it’s possible to look at past satellite images of the area too and in the case of some spits, it’s possible to see just how much they’ve changed in the past few years. </p>

<h2 id="bars">Bars</h2>

<p>If a spit forms between the two headlands defining a bay and there is no strong flow of water, the spit can cut off the bay by stretching between the two headlands. The spit is then known as a bar. An example of a bar is Slapton Ley in Devon. Again, it’s possible to see this landform using <a href="http://maps.google.com/?ll=50.25656,-3.61209&amp;z=12&amp;t=h">Google Maps</a></p>

<h2 id="tombolos">Tombolos</h2>

<p>Quite simply, a tombolo is a spit that has joined an island to the mainland. A good example of this is <a href="http://maps.google.com/?ll=50.57250,-2.46026&amp;z=14&amp;t=h">Chesil Beach</a> which joins the Isle of Portland to the mainland. </p>

<h2 id="haloseressalt-marshes">Haloseres/Salt Marshes</h2>

<p><em>Need an example of a salt marsh? Parkgate’s a good one. It’s located in the Wirral and has delicious ice creams.</em></p>

<p>A halosere is an ecological succession that develops in a salty environment. Guess where you can find salt? Besides on your table, yeah, the sea. Haloseres will nearly always form on coastlines and the most common type of halosere is a salt marsh. Salt marshes are interesting coastal landforms in that some people love them and some people hate them. They’re pretty popular with bird watchers and (obviously) geographers but sailors hate them and a lot of people think they’re ugly and would rather destroy them. Salt marshes are important coastal landforms though as they provide a very effective, sustainable method for <a href="/coasts/coastal-management/#marshland-creation">defending a coastline</a> against coastal erosion. </p>

<p>Salt marshes can only form in very low energy environments. The most common place to find salt marshes is behind a spit (known as the ‘lee’ of a spit (see above)) where there is stationary water and the area is shielded from the wind and waves. There still must be an input into the stationary water and the input must contain silt and clay. The best source of such an input is a river, even more reason for a salt marsh to form behind a spit. When the river meets the sea a process called flocculation takes place (you may have heard of this when studying deltas) where the silt and clay interact with the salt in the sea and fall out of solution. As the silt and clay fall out of solution and settle on the sea bed a mudflat forms. This process is known as (coastal) accretion. </p>

<p>In order to speed up coastal accretion, halophytic plants can be introduced. Halophytes are salt loving plants that can survive in the harsh conditions of the mudflats. They don’t mind salt water and can stand being submerged by it for several hours a day. They’re really tough plants and are often referred to as pioneer species since they’re the first things to live on a salt marsh. Examples of halophytes include grasswort and spartina. These plants have special adaptations to allow them to survive on the mudflats. Spartina, for example, have long roots that enable them to tap into the water table and access fresh water. They can also filter salt out of water so the need for these long roots is kind of negated by that fact. Glasswort is a fairly interesting species of plants since it is able to shed layers off of it. This is advantageous since it can get rid of build ups of salt and mud on its surface and so can continue to photosynthesise.</p>

<p>These halophytic plants help to speed up accretion by trapping mud and salt and forcing it to settle, gradually building up the depth of the mudflats. The accretion process is further aided by the build up of organic matter in the mudflat which not only increases the mudflats depth but also provides nutrients for new species of plants to grow. </p>

<p>As the salt marsh develops and the mudflats build up, new species of plants begin to grow including sea rush and the common reed. These plants only grow inland, away from the mudflats, since they’re not halophytes (you could call them halophobes). They <em>really</em> don’t like being submerged in water and can’t stand salt. Interestingly though, the seeds of the sea rush can germinate underwater which could be seen as stupid or clever, depending on how you look at it. </p>

<h3 id="the-attack-of-the-salt-marshes">The Attack of the Salt Marshes</h3>

<p>Salt marshes are really nice landforms in my opinion but a lot of people disagree. Many sailors hate the things since the plants that grow in salt marshes will jam up a ship’s motor. Worse yet, salt marshes develop in low energy areas, which is just where sailors like to ‘park’ their boats. Where I live, the Wirral, there’s an extensive salt marsh system that’s developed in an area called Parkgate. Just 100 years ago, Parkgate was a pretty big shipping area but now its basically dry land since a salt marsh developed uncontrollably in the area. This was due to two factors. First, the Dee Estuary (onto which Parkgate sits) had been dredged in order to improve its shipping capacity. This ended up harming shipping since it provided a large volume of sediment for a salt marsh to develop on. The second factor was the presence of the invasive spartina plant. The plant isn’t actually native to the UK, and was imported by ships coming in from America. The plant grows incredibly quickly though, which is why the salt marsh was able to develop in just a few decades. </p>

<h3 id="the-revenge-of-the-humans">The Revenge of the Humans</h3>

<p>Since salt marshes are pretty bad for business, people try to prevent salt marshes from developing since once they’ve developed, they’re pretty hard to get rid of. It’s common for people to engage in cleansing sessions where they basically try to remove all the plants that are growing on the forming salt marsh. This will seriously impede the marsh’s development since the only way for the marshes to build up would be via flocculation, which is very slow.</p>

<p>Once a marsh has developed though, as I said, they’re hard to get rid of. But hey, look on the bright side, you’ve got some new land to build on! People will often try to build things on marshes and such activity is known as land reclamation. It’s not really a good thing since salt marshes are home to many species of plants, birds and other fauna whose habitats are destroyed when people build on salt marshes. </p>

<p>Marshes are also at risk from agricultural damage. Salt marshes can be drained in order to provide land for cattle to be herded which can result in a reduction in biodiversity in the salt marsh as cattle selectively eat certain species of plants. It will also result in the death of many plants because of trampling. There’s also the issue of agricultural run off. Fertiliser that runs into salt marshes can be particularly dangerous as a process called eutrophication can take place. This is where algae in the water receive the nutrients in the fertiliser and begin multiplying like crazy. They form an opaque layer on top of water surfaces which prevents oxygen &amp; sunlight from reaching anything beneath the surface of the algae and hence kills and plants and animals beneath the surface. Not only that, it makes the water look pretty disgusting too. </p>

<p>The other risk to salt marshes actually isn’t due to humans (well, it could be). Sea level rise would be pretty devastating to salt marshes since they’re very low lying land forms and a very small rise is enough to flood and destroy them. </p>

<h2 id="the-revenge-of-the-humans-against-the-humans-who-are-getting-revenge-on-the-salt-marshes">The Revenge of the Humans Against the Humans Who Are Getting Revenge on the Salt Marshes</h2>

<p>Fortunately, there are some people who want to protect salt marshes (hello!) since they provide a very nice habitat for many species of animals. Unfortunately, there’s not a lot we can do to defend them against sea level rise since if we built a big barrier in front of the marsh to keep back any rising water, we’d slowly destroy the marsh anyway since it would no longer receive any inputs. </p>

<p>Even more unfortunate is the fact that there’s not a lot we can do to stop other people from destroying the marshes. Agricultural waste, by nature, is going to end up in marshes since it’s <em>always</em> going to enter the water cycle. People are going to continue to destroy the marshes because they house a threat to their businesses too. The best we can do is preserve the currently existing salt marshes by making them SSSIs (Sites of Special Scientific Interest) and entrusting them with conservation groups. The salt marsh at Parkgate, for example, is both an SSSI and an RSPB (Royal Society for the Protection of Birds) protected wetland since it has many species of rare birds nesting in it. </p>

<h2 id="psammoseressand-dunes">Psammoseres/Sand Dunes</h2>

<p>A psammosere is a community of ecological successions on a coastal system. The most common example of a Psammosere is a sand dune succession. The succession of sand dunes has a variety of ecological differences as you move further inland, making it a psammosere. </p>

<p>For sand dunes to form, several conditions are necessary. The section of coast must have a large tidal range as this will allow large amounts of sediment (the bed of the ocean of sea) to be exposed to winds. The presence of a prevailing wind is also greatly beneficial since this will provide powerful winds to transport the sand inland. Alternatively, a long fetch will help since this will provide high energy winds to move the sand inland. The wind will transport sediment on the bed of the sea via saltation during low tide. The sediment will move until it meets an obstacle which is normally found at the strand line. This is the maximum extent of the tide and is where lots of rubbish gets deposited. The rubbish will act as an obstacle and cause the sand to build up behind the rubbish forming embryo dunes. From this, a sand dune system begins to form. </p>

<p><img src="/Images/coasts/8depositionalFeatures/sandDuneSystem.png" alt="A diagram of a sand dune succession outlining the different types of sand dunes." /></p>

<h3 id="the-features-of-sand-dune-successions">The Features of Sand Dune Successions</h3>

<p>As the sand dune system moves inland, many changes take place to the sand dunes in terms of appearance, shape, size and the types of vegetation present in the sand dunes.</p>

<p>At the back of the beach, there is little in terms of sand dune development. Small mounds of sand may be beginning to develop behind deposited litter but they will be unable to grow too tall as the tide can still reach this section of the beach, destroying the developing dunes. The sand here has a very high pH caused by the presence of many discarded sea creature’s shells. These shells decompose and release alkali materials creating the alkaline conditions. Plant life is scarce, contributing to the high pH by lowering the availability of decomposing organic matter. Plants that do develop here are known as “pioneer species” and are particularly tough plants as they have to survive strong winds, salty conditions and being fully submerged in water for several hours straight. Examples of these pioneer plants include sea rocket and prickly saltwort. </p>

<p>A small distance inland, the first sand dunes begin to develop, referred to as <em>embryo dunes</em>. These dunes are relatively small in size and are nothing more than small bumps in the ground. Non-the-less, they represent an opportunity for plant life to develop and certain species of plants can grow on these embryo dunes, binding the sand together and acting as an obstacle to help more sand build up and the height of the sand dune to grow even more. Plants that grow on these embryo dunes include sea couch and lyme. These plants are able to grow vertically upwards through accumulating sand and possess several special adaptations to help them survive in the harsh conditions present on embryo dunes. To begin, these plants are xenophobic, so they are drought loving plants and are able to survive without water for extensive periods of time. These plants are also specially adapted to collect whatever water is available. They have long roots that allow them to tap into the water table and many species of plants have specially adapted leaves that help to collect water. The long roots also help to stabilise the plants in the sand, preventing them from being blown away in strong winds. This has the knock on effect of binding the sand and aiding sand dune growth. </p>

<p>Further inland again, foredunes (also referred to as mobile dunes) begin to develop. Larger than their embryonic cousins, these foredunes have new types of plant life developing on them as conditions become slightly easier for life. Marram grass develops on foredunes (and sometimes on embryo dunes too) which has many interesting adaptations for living in sand dunes. Like many species of plants, it has long roots to tap into the water supply. It is, however, marram grass’s shape that is interesting. Marram grass is a long, thin and spiky plant which helps to protect it from strong winds by making the marram grass more aerodynamic. What’s more interesting though is that the grass’s shape can change according to the weather conditions. During calm weather, the grass will be quite flat horizontally, allowing it to collect more water. However when the winds pick up, the grass folds in half, making it far more aerodynamic and reducing its chances of being damaged by the wind. </p>

<p>The pH of the soil that makes up foredunes begins to fall as the sand dune system moves inland. The soil becomes more acidic since organic matter from dead plants and animals begins to build up in the soil. This is evident from both the changing pH and the changing colour of the sand. The sand that makes up foredunes close to the back of the beach is very yellow due to the low concentration of organic matter, however further inland, the sand begins to turn grey due to a build up of organic matter. To differentiate between the differing soil, sections of the sand dune systems are divided into yellow dunes and grey dunes, indicating the acidity of the soil and concentration of plant life in an area. </p>

<p>The height of foredunes will eventually peak, after which the height of the dunes begins to fall again. The tallest dune is often referred to as the dune ridge and it’s after the dune ridge that plant life begins to change and more organic matter begins to build up as the dune ridge acts as a shelter for sand dunes behind it, shielding them from strong winds which helps create the right conditions for new plant life to develop but prevents dunes from growing too large by limiting the amount of sand they are exposed to. </p>

<p>Dunes developing after the dune ridge are normally grey dunes and have a much lower height. Fixed dunes generally develop first. The more sheltered nature of fixed dunes means that flowering plants and moss begin to develop and marram grass becomes far less common. It is replaced with a type of grass known as fescue grass. </p>

<p>Between dunes beyond the dune ridge dune slacks can develop. These are depressions between the sand dunes that are low enough that the ground is very close to, or on, the water table. This creates very moist conditions and allows new plants to develop including reeds and rushes. </p>

<p>Beyond the dune slacks and fixed dunes, the sand begins to run out and the development of sand dunes stops. Woodlands with trees such as pine and oak begin to develop and a climatic climax begins to develop. That is, unless humans interfere. In many sand dune systems, humans have interfered by planting conifers in the sand dunes in an attempt to stabilise them, which leads to the formation of a plagio-climax and different types of vegetation beyond the sand dunes. </p>

<h3 id="sand-dune-blowouts">Sand Dune Blowouts</h3>

<p>A blowout is a feature of sand dune successions that marks the location of a now destroyed sand dune. They are thought to be caused by the destruction of plants within a sand dune due to trampling by humans. As the plants die, the roots that bind the sand dunes together and help to stabilise the sand dunes die as well. This results in the sand dunes being unsupported and, during strong winds, a large section of sand is removed from the sand dune forming a large concave depression within the sand dune known as a blow out. </p>

<p>While blow outs are destructive to sand dunes, they can help develop the overall ecological system by providing a sheltered niche for new species of plants to grow in. </p>

<h3 id="sand-dune-protection">Sand Dune Protection</h3>

<p>Sand dune systems are relatively fragile systems and are highly susceptible to damage and interference from humans. We therefore take it upon ourselves to protect sand dune systems and we do so using a variety of methods. Many of the methods used are soft engineering techniques so they are low cost, low technology and work with nature. </p>

<p>Sand dunes, more specifically the vegetation that covers sand dunes, are susceptible to a process known as trampling which is were humans (or other animals) crush plants on sand dunes that can lead to the aforementioned blow outs. In order to limit trampling and prevent blow outs, sand dune management takes place and restricted access is granted to areas of sand dune systems. Footpaths are constructed to limit the trampling of plants to certain areas and these footpaths are fenced off in order to prevent people from wondering off onto sand dunes. Some types of footpaths, known as boardwalks, are made of wooden slats in them which allow plants to grow underneath the boardwalks and therefore continue to bind the sand in that particular area. </p>

<p>Educating tourists is a particularly effective way of reducing damage to sand dunes. Information boards will limit the number of tourists who simply ignore the “no access” signs by actually providing them with a reason to obey them. </p>

<p>In order to stabilise sand dunes, dead fern trees can be planted in the sand to help trap the sand and build up new sand dunes. These trees will also bind the sand very well, making the sand dunes stable for many years. </p>

<p><img src="/Images/coasts/8depositionalFeatures/sandDunePineBuildUpFormby.jpg" alt="An image showing trees that have been planted at Formby Sand Dunes to help rebuild the dunes" /></p>

<p>The above image, taken at Formby Sand Dunes, shows the amazing result of planting dead trees to help build up sand dunes. The more recent trees can be seen close to the surface but the entire sand dune system visible is the result of soft engineering techniques. The area photographed is also an “out of bounds” area and has a sign stating that unauthorised access is not allowed. </p>

<h2 id="socialist-healthcare-systems---the-uk--the-nhs">Socialist Healthcare Systems - The UK &amp; The NHS</h2>

<h3 id="how-its-funded">How It’s Funded</h3>

<p>The NHS is a publicly funded healthcare system that is payed for by the government via taxes. The NHS accounts for around 16.5% of the UK government’s total spending.</p>

<h3 id="how-it-works">How It Works</h3>

<p>People are able to choose a GP of their own liking and can swap and change GPs whenever they wish. Despite this, many GPs will only accept patients from a small catchment area, so in reality, there’s a lot less choice in a person’s GP. The GP acts as an access point to the NHS’s specialist services. When a patient has a medical problem they can book an appointment with a GP who will then see the patient and attempt to diagnose them with a condition. Once the patient has been diagnosed, or if he/she can’t be diagnosed, the patient is referred to a relevant department within a hospital or specialist treatment centre so that they can receive the care that they need. </p>

<p>Obviously the GP method won’t work during an emergency which is where the A&amp;E (Accident &amp; Emergency) department comes into play. All hospital’s have an A&amp;E department and it is a walk in department for people who have suddenly fallen critically ill. People can receive specialist treatment from an A&amp;E department without a referral from their GP. </p>

<h3 id="who-can-access-it">Who Can Access It?</h3>

<p>Anybody can access the NHS health service, even those who don’t pay their national insurance tax such as immigrants. The only difficulty arrises when someone without an address tries to use the service. In order to obtain a GP, a person must have an address, so a homeless individual’s medical care would be limited to the A&amp;E section of hospital’s only. The person would be unable to receive any follow up care after treatment in A&amp;E due to their lack of a GP. </p>

<h2 id="forced-healthcare---france">Forced Healthcare - France</h2>

<h3 id="how-its-funded-1">How It’s Funded</h3>

<p>The French system is a compulsory healthcare system in that people are required to pay a percentage of their salary towards a health insurance. The amount is very small, less than 1% of their salary, with employers paying 12.8% of their salary to make up the rest of the health insurance. In addition to this mandatory payment, people can choose to pay an optional top-up fee of 2.5% their salary to cover the costs of more types of treatment and to receive an overall better experience in the healthcare system. People who earn less than €6,600 per year are <strong>not</strong> required to pay health insurance as their healthcare is covered by the state. </p>

<h3 id="how-it-works-1">How It Works</h3>

<p>Similar to the UK, people have access to GPs (these are general physicians though and not general practitioners). These GPs provide basic medical services and can diagnose people with illnesses and provide a limited amount of treatment. Unlike in the UK, however, switching GPs is far easier in France as people aren’t bound to a specific GP. In addition, a referral from a GP is not required for any specialist treatment at a hospital, people can just walk in and make an appointment for treatment. </p>

<h3 id="who-can-access-it-1">Who Can Access It?</h3>

<p>All French nationals can access the healthcare system as they will have either payed an insurance contribution or they’ll be covered by the state. </p>

<h2 id="voluntary-healthcare---the-usa">Voluntary Healthcare - The USA</h2>

<h3 id="how-its-funded-2">How It’s Funded</h3>

<p>Healthcare in the USA is almost entirely private and is based on the free market and survival of the richest models. Individuals must choose a health insurance package that covers certain types of treatments and pay a monthly or yearly fee for that insurance. The cost of health insurance varies based on the package a person has. On average, healthcare for a family of four costs around $10,000 per year (about 1/2 the yearly wage of a Walmart employee). The health care services themselves receive little in terms of funding from the government, instead relying on payments from people for treatment.</p>

<h3 id="how-it-works-2">How It Works</h3>

<p>Much like the French system, people can receive general treatments from a physician or receive specialist treatment at a hospital without the need for a referral. The treatment that a person can receive, however, is limited to the health insurance package that they are paying for. </p>

<h3 id="who-can-access-it-2">Who Can Access It?</h3>

<p>As mentioned above, provided a person is paying enough for their insurance, they can access any health care services. If a person doesn’t have the right insurance package for their treatment though, or if the person just doesn’t have insurance, they must either pay the full price of the treatment upfront, beg for help from a charity or just do without the treatment. For people without insurance, a service called <em>Medicaid</em> provides very basic treatment from the state however it’s very limited in terms of what treatment people can access. <em>Medicare</em> is a service that provides health insurance to those over the age of 65, again, paid for by the state. </p>

The best way to do any of these is using a case study so below is a case study about the healthcare services in the Wirral, who provides them and how healthcare differs within the Wirral. </p>

<p>A quick bit of background information. <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=The+Wirral&amp;hl=en&amp;ll=53.366683,-3.054959&amp;spn=0.215101,0.477219&amp;sll=53.426351,-3.066695&amp;sspn=0.000839,0.001864&amp;t=v&amp;hnear=Wirral,+United+Kingdom&amp;z=11">The Wirral</a> is located in the north west of England. It’s a peninsula and is separated from the city of Liverpool by the River Mersey and from Wales by the River Dee (or, more specifically, their estuaries). To the north of the Wirral is the Irish Sea. The Wirral itself has several large(ish) towns including Caldy, Hoylake &amp; West Kirby in the west and Wallasey &amp; Birkenhead in the north and east respectively. </p>

<h2 id="healthcare-in-the-wirral">Healthcare in The Wirral</h2>

<ul>
  <li>The <em>Wirral Primary Care Trust</em> (WPCT) decides on health services needed by the population and secures the continual provision of the services that are needed for the general population. The WPCT provides primary care and services itself and commissions other organisations to provide secondary care. The primary care provided includes doctors, dentists, opticians, pharmacists &amp; health visitors. The WPCT provides over 60 GP surgeries. </li>
  <li>The <em>Wirral Hospitals Trust</em> is responsible for most major operations and specialist treatments. The only way to gain access to a WHT department is via a referral from a  GP or directly through A&amp;E. </li>
  <li>The <em>Cheshire &amp; Wirral Partnership NHS Trust</em> provides specialist treatment and services for people with mental health issues, learning disabilities and drug &amp; alcohol problems.</li>
  <li><em>Clatterbridge Centre for Oncology</em> is an NHS foundation trust. It provides specialist cancer treatment for most of the north west of England. </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="the-wirral-health-profile">The Wirral Health Profile</h2>

<ul>
  <li>The health of people in the Wirral varies greatly both within the area and when compared to the rest of England. </li>
  <li>Many health statistics are worse than their average throughout England. For example, Wirral’s average life expectancy for men &amp; women is lower than the national average. In addition, the number of people who eat ‘healthy food’ in the Wirral is less than the national average. </li>
  <li>Conversely, many statistics are also better than the national average’s. The number of adults who smoke cigarettes, for example, is less than the national average. In addition, the number of people who are obese is also lower than the national average. </li>
  <li>There are inequalities in the Wirral in terms of employment, environmental and deprivation and these inequalities have different effects on the health of people in different areas of the Wirral. People in the north &amp; east of the Wirral, for example, generally have lower health standards due to a more deprived lifestyle. Conversely, people in the west of the Wirral in areas such as Caldy &amp; Hoylake, have better healthcare and longer life expectancies due to a higher standard of living and a (generally) higher income. </li>
  <li>The Wirral Strategic Partnership has prioritised health inequalities including smoking, alcohol abuse, employment, teenage pregnancies and child obesity. </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="health-prioritiesservices">Health Priorities/Services</h2>

<p>The services provided to combat these health inequalities include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Free health clinics.</li>
  <li>Free activities e.g. Yoga, Salsa dancing, 5-a-side football etc. </li>
  <li>Free healthy living courses e.g. Healthy cookery lessons, Stop smoking courses etc.</li>
  <li>Extensive opportunities for leisure through parks, open spaces and the coastline. </li>

                <content type="html"><![CDATA[ <p>Flooding occurs when a river’s discharge exceeds its channel’s volume causing the river to overflow onto the area surrounding the channel known as the floodplain. The increase in discharge can be triggered by several events. The most common cause of flooding is prolonged rainfall. If it rains for a long time, the ground will become saturated and the soil will no longer be able to store water leading to increased surface runoff. Rainwater will enter the river much faster than it would if the ground wasn’t saturated leading to higher discharge levels and floods. </p>

<p>As well as prolonged rainfall, brief periods of heavy rain can also lead to floods. If there’s a sudden “burst” of heavy rain, the rainwater won’t be able to infiltrate fast enough and the water will instead enter the river via surface runoff. This leads to a sudden and large increase in the river’s discharge which can result in a <em>flash flood</em>. </p>

<p>Although many floods are triggered directly by precipitation just a few hours after it falls some floods can be triggered by precipitation that fell many months ago. Precipitation that falls as snow can remain as snow on the ground until it melts. This mightn’t be until the end of winter, so potentially several months. When the snow does melt, large volumes of meltwater will enter the river increasing its discharge and triggering floods. These floods are often annual, occurring every year when snow melts in the spring. In Bangladesh, for example, melting snow in the Himalayas triggers annual floods in the summer.</p>

<p>Flash floods can also be triggered by slightly more catastrophic events. Erupting volcanoes can trigger very large flash floods called jökulhlaups when glaciers are partially or even fully melted by an erupting volcano or some other form of geothermal activity. The meltwater can enter rivers and greatly increase the river’s discharge leading to a flood. The eruption of Eyjafjallajökull<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup> in 2010 triggered jökulhlaups as the volcano had been capped by a glacier that melted when it erupted<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">2</a></sup>.</p>

<h2 id="factors-affecting-flood-frequency">Factors Affecting Flood Frequency</h2>

<h3 id="physical-factors">Physical Factors</h3>

<ul>
  <li>The size and shape of a river’s drainage basin dictates how much precipitation the river can receive and how quickly it will arrive (the lag time). A large drainage basin means that the river’s catchment area is large so it will collect a lot of water, increasing discharge. If the basin is circular in shape, the precipitation will enter the river at roughly the same time because all points in the basin are equidistant from one another. This will produce a high peak discharge and can lead to flash floods. </li>
  <li>The permeability of the soil and rock in a drainage basin is a big factor in flooding. If the basin’s soil is impermeable, maybe because it has been saturated by previous rainfall or has been baked by prolonged heating, then any precipitation that falls won’t infiltrate and will instead run straight into the river, increasing the river’s discharge and triggering floods. Similarly, if the rocks in the area are non-porous or impermeable (such as granite or clay) then water won’t be able to infiltrate into the rocks and will, again, run straight off into the river increasing its discharge.</li>
  <li>The vegetation cover in a basin will affect flooding. If a basin has very dense vegetation cover, the vegetation will intercept precipitation and store it, reducing the volume of water entering a river. Conversely, if a basin is sparsely vegetated then there will be no interception and so more water will enter a river. Vegetation helps bind soil too. With no vegetation, the soil is highly susceptible to mass wasting which can cause large volumes of soil to enter a river and reduce the river’s capacity.</li>
  <li>The relief and steepness of the basin affects how quickly water enters a river and so how likely a river is to flood. If the river’s valley has steep sides, water will quickly enter a river increasing the river’s discharge. </li>
  <li>The number of tributaries flowing into a river affects the likelihood of floods. If a river has a lot of tributaries, the river’s discharge will be much higher because lots of water will be entering it from its tributaries. After heavy precipitation, the discharge will rise even more and floods are likely, especially at confluences (where a tributary meets the river) as this is where discharge is highest.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="human-factors">Human Factors</h3>

<ul>
  <li>If a river’s drainage basin or floodplain has been heavily urbanised, a river becomes much more prone to flooding. Urbanisation (generally) involves the laying down of tarmac and concrete, impermeable substances that will increase surface runoff into the river and therefore increase the river’s discharge. </li>
  <li>Urbanisation often involves deforestation. This (obviously) reduces vegetation cover, reducing infiltration and increasing surface runoff into a river. </li>
  <li>To stop roads and streets from flooding, humans will often build storm drains that collect rainwater and channel it into a river or stream. Stupid/cheap humans will often send this water to the local river or stream so, although roads and streets won’t be flooded by rainwater the entire town will be as the rainwater enters the river <em>much</em> faster than it would without the storm drains.</li>
</ul>

<p>Climate change is a physical factor that could, potentially, be a human factor. Changes in the climate mean that certain areas are going to experience more frequent and more intense storms that can lead to large floods. Whether this is a human factor is debatable as, while climate change is definitely happening, whether it’s the result of human activity is still uncertain. We’re probably not helping but keep in mind that the planet’s climate would be changing regardless of humanity’s existence because at this moment in time, we’re still in the tail end of an ice age. </p>

<h2 id="the-effects-of-flooding">The Effects of Flooding</h2>

<p>Flooding can have numerous social, economic and environmental effects that can vary depending on the demographics of a population and the economic development of an area. </p>

<h3 id="social-effects">Social Effects</h3>

<p>The biggest, most obvious effect is <em>death</em>. Floods, especially flash floods, will kill people. Flood water can travel surprisingly quickly and weighs<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote">3</a></sup> a lot, so people can easily get swept away by floods. Large chunks of debris and objects like cars can easily get picked up by floodwater and can easily kill a person should they get hit by the debris. In a LEDC, you’re generally going to get much more deaths than you would in a MEDC. In a MEDC, people and governments are better prepared for floods. Rescue services can be dispatched to a flood quickly in a MEDC whereas in a LEDC, rescue teams mightn’t arrive until several hours after the flood started.</p>

<p>During a flood, sewage pipes are often broken and raw sewage leaks into the floodwater. This has two effects. First, it contaminates not just floodwater but drinking water too which leads to a spread of waterborne diseases such as cholera especially in LEDCs where emergency drinking water mightn’t be available. Second, the sewage gets into people’s homes which is just horrible, disgusting and incredibly difficult to clean.</p>

<p>In LEDCs, famines can follow floods which can lead to even more deaths. Floods will commonly inundate farmland because farmland normally develops on floodplains. If the floodwater is polluted by sewage, it will contaminate the farmland and make any food grown on it dangerous to eat. Furthermore, cattle are often killed by floods which can lead to people starving because they either don’t have a source of food or don’t have a source of income to buy food with. </p>

<h3 id="economic-effects">Economic Effects</h3>

<p>The big economic effect of a flood is property damage. Water can cause a lot of damage to property and when it picks up large chunks of debris such as cars, it can act like a wrecking ball, taking out chunks of buildings when cars crash into them. Very large and powerful floods can even dislodge buildings from their foundations and move them. In a MEDC, property damage is often extensive as people have lots of expensive possessions. This isn’t the case in LEDCs but that’s only because people don’t have a lot to lose in the first place. This means that the overall cost of a flood is generally substantially higher in a MEDC than in a LEDC.</p>

<p>Floods can cause extensive damage to infrastructure such as power lines, roads, water pipes etc. Bridges frequently collapse during a flood as they aren’t designed to withstand the high discharge of the river. The Northside Bridge in Workington, Cumbria collapsed when there were large floods in 2009. Repairing bridges and other types of infrastructure is very costly. Not only this, it can lead to a decline in the local economy as businesses are unable to operate without power or road connections. Unemployment can even increase if businesses are unable to fully recover from a flood. The economic impact of infrastructure damage and unemployment is larger in MEDCs since these countries have modern and expensive infrastructure in place. In LEDCs, this infrastructure is lacking, so there isn’t much economic damage. In fact, in a LEDC, floods can lead to positive economic effects in the long term. An influx of funding to a less developed area from charities and NGOs after a flood can result in new infrastructure being constructed that is substantially better than the previously existing infrastructure. This, in turn, creates new economic opportunities in an area by, for example, creating new trade routes. </p>

<p>Another economic benefit comes from when a river floods and deposits sediment across the floodplain. This improves the fertility of the floodplain and can  improve agricultural yield in an area (assuming the floodwater wasn’t polluted).</p>

<h3 id="environmental-effects">Environmental Effects</h3>

<p>Floodwater that is contaminated with sewage will pollute rivers and land when it drains back into the river. Similarly, if the river floods onto farmland, the water can be polluted by pesticides and other chemicals sprayed onto the farmland that, when drained back into the river, can pollute it and kill off wildlife that inhabits the river. If the floodwater isn’t polluted though, flooding can create wetlands that can help introduce new habitats for many species of animals.</p>

<h2 id="the-recurrence-interval">The Recurrence Interval</h2>

<p>The recurrence interval is a way of measuring the frequency of a flood of a specific size occurring. The accuracy of the recurrence interval is dependent on the amount of historical data available about previous floods. The recurrence interval tells you how many years you’d expect to have between a flood of a certain size. In general, a large flood has a large recurrence interval so it isn’t very frequent. A small flood will have a smaller and more frequent recurrence interval. The recurrence interval can be calculated using the following formula<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote">4</a></sup>:</p>

<p>\[ T = \frac{n+1}{m} \]</p>

<p>\(T\) is the recurrence interval, \(n\) is the number of years on record and \(m\) is the ranking of the flood relative to all the other floods on record for a specific river. </p>

<p>For example, a flood with a discharge of 200m<sup>3</sup>s<sup>-1</sup> occurred at some point in the river’s past. Out of a data set spanning 199 years<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote">5</a></sup>, this flood was the 2<sup>nd</sup> largest in terms of discharge. Using the formula, this means that a flood of this size is expected to occur once every 100 years (\(\frac{199+1}{2}\)). We’d describe it as a 1 in 100 year flood.</p>

<p>Of course, this doesn’t mean that a flood of this size won’t occur for another 100 years. It just means that statistically it won’t. More than anything, the recurrence interval is a nice way of describing a complicated topic using simple Maths. At the end of the day though, the recurrence interval raises more questions than it answers because after a big flood all the newspapers say that it was a 1 in 300 hundred year flood and everybody feels safe that a big flood won’t affect them for another 300 years and then the river goes and floods again the next year and everybody’s all “But it wasn’t supposed to flood for another 300 years” and then somebody explains that that’s just an average and really the river can flood at anytime. People don’t like that sort of unpredictability though, so they’ll just blame the scientists/statisticians and say they got it wrong. </p>

<p>The point I’m trying to get at is that the recurrence interval isn’t the most useful thing in the world because it’s just an average and averages can (and often do) have anomalies. There’s nothing to stop a river having a 1 in 1000 year flood and then doing the same the next day. The other problem with the recurrence interval is that it’s based on past data. Rivers are dynamic beasts, they change and when they change, so does how they flood. While the recurrence interval’s accuracy increases as you add more data, the reliability decreases because the river’s flooding patterns will have changed over time. </p>

<h2 id="flooding-in-a-medc---2004-boscastle-floods">Flooding in a MEDC - 2004 Boscastle Floods</h2>

<p>On the 16<sup>th</sup> of August, 2004, the small town of Boscastle was almost completely destroyed in the space of just two hours when a 1 in 400 year flash flood occurred at around 3pm and inundated most of the town.</p>

<h2 id="location">Location</h2>

<p><img src="/Images/rivers/boscastle-gmap.png" alt="The location of boscastle on a map." /></p>

<ul>
  <li>Boscastle is located in southwest England less than a kilometre from the coastline. The River Valency flows directly through the town and meets the River Jordan at a confluence in the town. The river valleys are steep and composed of shale, an impermeable rock. </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="causes">Causes</h2>

<ul>
  <li>A combination of the remnants of Hurricane Alex and convectional rainfall triggered by the intense heating of the ground by the summer heat led to heavy rainfall over the south of England. In two hours over 60mm of rain fell in Boscastle and by the end of the flood, nearly 200mm had fallen. </li>
  <li>The rain fell over Bodmin Moor, an area composed of impermeable shale that is has sparse vegetation cover. This increased surface runoff due to a lack of both infiltration and interception, increasing the volume of water entering the River Valency and its tributaries. </li>
  <li>The River Valency’s valley has a high relief and steep sides so surface runoff was increased.</li>
  <li>The ground had been saturated by previous rainfall<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote">6</a></sup>, reducing infiltration and increasing surface runoff.</li>
  <li>The River’s floodplain had been urbanised reducing infiltration and increasing surface runoff. </li>
  <li>The River Valency had a confluence with the River Jordan directly in Boscastle leading to huge volumes of water flowing through the town when both river’s discharge increased.</li>
  <li>As the River Valency flowed through Boscastle, its channel had been walled off preventing it from adjusting to the increased discharge and limiting its efficiency, ultimately causing it flood. </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="effects">Effects</h2>

<h3 id="economic">Economic</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Insurance claims came in between £15,000 and £30,000 per property. There was the potential for insurance prices to rise as a result of the flood but this was unlikely because of the rarity of a flood of this scale.</li>
  <li>Businesses were badly damaged with property destroyed or filled with silt, sewage and debris. </li>
  <li>One of the main sources of income in Boscastle was tourism. After the events of the flood, people were less willing to travel to Boscastle because of the (low) risk of another flood occurring.</li>
  <li>76 cars were washed out to sea because of the low lying nature of the town’s car park.</li>
  <li>The “lower bridge” was badly damaged when debris blocked it and water pooled behind it. When the temporary dam finally gave, a 3m wave was released that caused even more damage to buildings downstream of the bridge. </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="social">Social</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Nobody was killed thanks to the rescue efforts but some people suffered from broken bones &amp; hypothermia.</li>
  <li>Houses were flooded and silt, sewage &amp; debris was deposited inside of them.</li>
  <li>Water &amp; power supplies were taken out during the flood.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="environmental">Environmental</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Raw sewage was washed out to sea and into the River Valency.</li>
  <li>75 cars &amp; 6 buildings were washed out to sea. </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="short-term-responses">Short Term Responses</h2>

<ul>
  <li>A flood warning was issued for parts of Cornwall at 3:30pm but Boscastle wasn’t specifically warned. </li>
  <li>Just a few hours after the river flooded, a search and rescue operation was underway which lasted until 2:30am the next day. Over 150 people were saved by search and rescue operations.</li>
  <li>11 Days after the flood people were allowed to return to their homes to salvage their belongings. Living in their homes wasn’t really viable at this stage. </li>
  <li>Prince Charles visited the town 2 days after the flood and donated a large sum of money to the town.</li>
  <li>A few days after the flood, geologists flew over the area to assess the risk of landslides triggered by the heavy rain. </li>
  <li>North Cornwall Council provided accommodation for 11 tourists who were unable to return home after the flood. The night after the disaster, 100 people used the Camelford leisure centre as a refuge.</li>
</ul>

  <li>Reconstruction didn’t begin until 2005 as the council waited on a report from hydrologists to determine the recurrence interval of the flood.</li>
  <li>By early 2005, power and water was back up. </li>
  <li>The council invested money into improving Boscastle’s flood defences and the Environmental Agency also built new flood defences. In 2006, the channel was widened and deepened to increase its capacity and ability to handle sudden increases in discharge. In 2007, these defences were put to the test and a much smaller, more controlled flood occurred. </li>
  <li>The remains of the “lower bridge” that triggered a 3m wave were demolished and replaced with a larger bridge that would be more difficult to block with debris.</li>
  <li>The effects of the flood caused people in Boscastle to take their environmental footprint far more seriously because they were led to believe that climate change exacerbated by human activity was responsible for the “freak weather” that caused the river to flood. When buildings were reconstructed, they were done so in an environmentally friendly manner with insulation, double glazing etc. being installed in the new buildings. The town won 5 awards for its eco-friendliness.</li>

<h2 id="flooding-in-a-ledc---2008-bihar-floods">Flooding in a LEDC - 2008 Bihar 	Floods</h2>

<p>During the months of August and September in 2008 there was a long period of heavy rainfall along the foothills of the Himalayas. The rainfall ultimately led to widespread floods in Bihar, an Indian state, that made millions homeless and claimed the lives of hundreds of people. </p>

<h3 id="location-1">Location</h3>

<p>Bihar is located in the north east of India, to the south of the Himalayas bordering Nepal. It is one of the poorest states in India where the caste class system, despite its lack of legality, is still in widespread use. In Bihar, 42% of the population lives below the poverty line. Through Bihar flows the River Kosi, a tributary to the Ganges. </p>

<h3 id="causes-1">Causes</h3>

<p>Monsoon season in India occurs in the late summer months and is caused by the seasonal reversal of winds in the area. The monsoon brought heavy rainfall to the foothills of the Himalayas and dramatically increased the discharge of the River Kosi. The river was forced to flow into a channel that it hadn’t flown through in over 100 years. In doing so, it flooded a large portion of Bihar. </p>

<p>The flooding was worsened by the deforestation that had taken place in the River Kosi’s drainage basin. The lack of vegetation cover meant that rain water wasn’t intercepted and easily flowed into the river via surface runoff.</p>

<p>The River Kosi had flood defences that were supposed to handle approximately 30,000m<sup>3</sup> of water per second<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote">7</a></sup> but were breached at a fraction of that capacity suggesting that the defences were defective or poorly maintained. </p>

<h2 id="effects-1">Effects</h2>

<h3 id="social-1">Social</h3>

<ul>
  <li>The flood killed 500-2000 people. Figures vary because government figures don’t include missing people while figures from aid agencies do. </li>
  <li>3 million people were made homeless and sent to refuge camps.</li>
  <li>A shortage of clean drinking water and the warm climate meant that water born and vector diseases were easily spread.</li>
  <li>Shortages of food and emergency grain quickly developed. 70% of Bihar’s population are farmers, many of which are subsistence farmers. When 100,000 Ha of land was flooded, most of their food was destroyed. </li>
  <li>There were allegations of discrimination when it came to evacuating people. It was claimed that the rich were evacuated first and given the most emergency food while some members of the “untouchables” (the lowest class in the caste system and Hindu society) weren’t evacuated at all. </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="economic-1">Economic</h3>

<ul>
  <li>70% of Bihar’s population are farmers and 100,000 Ha of land was inundated by floodwater, destroying wheat and rice that could be traded.</li>
  <li>Roads were destroyed, costing money to repair and disrupting trade.</li>
  <li>The disaster ended up costing nearly $542 million according to some reports.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="environmental-1">Environmental</h3>

<ul>
  <li>The flood will have washed sewage and pollutants into the River Kosi, polluting it and killing off some wildlife. </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="short-term-responses-1">Short Term Responses</h2>

<ul>
  <li>The Indian government created a £115m relief package to be sent to Bihar.</li>
  <li>The government released 125,000 tonnes of emergency grain that was to be distributed in Bihar. Allegations that the grain wasn’t evenly distributed arose though, with members of the lower class of Indian society being left with minimal amounts of grain while the upper classes received most of the grain.</li>
  <li>400,000 people were evacuated to relief camps. </li>
  <li>1,500 soldiers were sent to help rescue citizens and disperse aid. Helicopters were also provided but were limited in their effectiveness due to the continued heavy rain. </li>
  <li>Aid agencies were dispatched to Bihar and were especially important in ensuring that the lower classes of society were given aid. Aid agencies provided rescue efforts, food, clean water supplies and shelter.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="long-term-responses-1">Long Term Responses</h2>

<ul>
  <li>The World Bank gave significant funds to help Bihar recover and rebuild after the disaster. It also helped in creating plans to help improve the quality of living to standards above those seen before the disaster. </li>
  <li>An “Owner Driven Housing Reconstruction” scheme was created, funded by the World Bank, to give money to homeowners to rebuild their homes using bamboo, bricks, corrugated iron &amp; concrete. Each household was given $1,200 for the reconstruction with $50 going towards a toilet and $110 towards solar powered lighting. The scheme also gave $110 to households that did not own their own land so that they could go out and buy some. </li>
  <li>New bridges and roads were constructed to a higher standard than those that had previously been constructed. When the plan to reconstruct infrastructure was laid out, it was expected that 90 bridges and 290km of road would be reconstructed, benefiting 2 million people.</li>
  <li>New flood defences were constructed and people were educated on how to maintain them. It was estimated to cost $500 million to build new embankments, strengthen existing embankments, improve flood management and improve flood prediction technologies.</li>
</ul>

<p>For a hugely detailed list of the responses laid out by the World Bank, have a look at <a href="http://www.drrprojects.net/drrp/default/download/drrpp_file.file.959a199215e44435.57422d42696861722d4b6f73695f5265636f766572792e504446.PDF">this PDF file</a>. It’s long but very detailed.</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>Crude Birth Rate</em> - The total number of births in a single year per 1000 of the population. This doesn’t include the age and sex structure of a population.</li>
  <li><em>General Fertility Rate</em> - The number of live births per 1000 women aged 15 to 49 in one year. May also be used to derive the general fertility rate for women in particular age bands. </li>
  <li><em>Fertility rate</em> - The average number of children born to a woman in her life time. </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="world-fertility-levels">World Fertility Levels</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Fertility is still high in most of the least developed countries and although it is expected to decline, it will remain higher than the rest of the world.</li>
  <li>In the rest of the developing countries, fertility has declined markedly since the late 1960’s and is expected to reach below replacement level by 2050 in the majority of these countries.</li>
  <li>Below replacement fertility prevails in the developed regions and is expected to continue to 2050. </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="replacement-level-fertility">Replacement Level Fertility</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Replacement level fertility is the level of fertility at which a population exactly replaces itself from generation to generation. </li>
  <li>In developed countries, replacement level fertility can be taken as an average of 2.1 per woman. </li>
  <li>In countries with high infant mortality rates, however, the average number of births may need to be much higher. </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="social">Social</h3>

<h4 id="level-of-healthcare">Level Of Healthcare</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Improvements in health care, sanitation &amp; diet lead to a drop in infant mortality rate e.g. The Demographic Republic of Congo has a total fertility rate of 6.91 and 0.088 doctors per 1000 people. </li>
  <li>Availability of contraceptives for couples with knowledge and desire to use it e.g. Rwanda, where 10% of women practice modern methods of family planning and where the total fertility rate is 5.12. In Brazil, 70% of women practice modern methods of family planning and the total fertility rate is 2.21.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="level-of-education">Level Of Education</h4>

<ul>
  <li>In some countries, access to healthcare and education may be limited e.g. Afghanistan, total fertility rate of 7.7 with 0.17 doctors per 1000 &amp; a female literacy rate of 13%. </li>
  <li>Higher female literacy rates lead to improved knowledge of birth control, more opportunities for employment and more choice. This may lead to lower fertility rates. </li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h3 id="cultural">Cultural</h3>

<h4 id="religion">Religion</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Islam and the Roman Catholic church oppose the use of birth control although this influence may lesson with economic development.</li>
  <li>In many parts of the world religion/tradition demands high rates of reproduction.</li>

    <p>With the prospect of a career, women may have less children and marry later. e.g. the average marital age in the UK is 30. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Reduced access to formal employment and other income earning opportunities means women are forced to devote most of their time and energy to child bearing.</p>

<h4 id="the-cost-of-having-children">The Cost Of Having Children</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Children are seen as economic assets in LEDCs. They can be used as workers on land or to bring in more income. </li>
  <li>The time spent in education and the cost of childcare makes it more expensive to have a child. In the UK (TFR 1.66) the estimated cost of raising a child to 21 is £166,000. </li>

                <content type="html"><![CDATA[ <h2 id="headlands--bays-eg-swanage-bay">Headlands &amp; Bays (e.g. Swanage Bay)</h2>

<p>Headlands and bays, such as Swanage Bay, form on discordant coastlines, where hard and soft rock run in layers at 90˚ to the water. Alternating layers of hard and soft rock allow the sea to erode the soft rock faster, forming a bay but leaving hard rock sticking out, known as a headland. The altering rate of erosion of hard and soft rock is known as differential erosion. As the bay develops, wave refraction around the headlands begins to occur, increasing erosion of the headlands but reducing the erosion and development of the bay due to a loss of wave energy. Headlands and bays can form on concordant coastlines too, as has happened with Lulworth Cove, but this requires the rock to have already been weakened, possibly during an ice age. Irrespective of whether the coastline is concordant or discordant, as wave refraction takes place around the headlands and erosion of the bay is reduced, sub-aerial weathering such as corrosion and corrasion begins to weather the bay, furthering its development. </p>

<p><img src="/Images/coasts/7featuresOfErosion/formationOfBay.png" alt="A diagram showing the formation of a bay" /></p>

<h2 id="wave-cut-notches--platforms">Wave Cut Notches &amp; Platforms</h2>

<p>A wave cut notch is simply a small indent at the base of a cliff formed when a cliff is undercut by the sea. When a wave breaks on a cliff, all of the wave’s energy is concentrated on one specific point and this section of the cliff experiences more rapid erosion via corrasion. This eventually leads to the formation of a wave cut notch, when the cliff has been undercut. As the cliff has been undercut, the section of the cliff above the notch (the overhanging rock) no longer has any support and will, eventually, collapse. The repeated process of the collapse of the cliff and then the undercutting of the cliff is often referred to as the “retreat” of the cliff. As the cliff retreats, a gentle platform (with a gradient less than 5˚), referred to as a wave cut platform, is left behind. This platform is heavily scarred by erosion from the transportation of rock across it. As the platform grows, the waves have to travel further to reach the cliff and they’ll lose more and more of their energy. Once the platform reaches a certain size, the waves will have too little energy by the time they reach the cliff to undercut it and so there is a physical limit on the size a wave cut platform can be.</p>

<h2 id="formation-of-caves-stacks-stumps-arches-blowholes--geos">Formation of Caves, Stacks, Stumps, Arches, Blowholes &amp; Geos</h2>

<p>Stacks, caves and arches are all iconic features of coastlines. They are also all linked together, along with stumps and arches as they are part of a series of landforms that form as a coast is eroded. Areas on a stretch of coast that have small cracks and joints on them are particularly susceptible to attack from waves, along with bedding planes that lie inline with the direction of the waves. These areas will be eroded very quickly and can be eroded in one of two ways. The first way is simply eroding the crack and causing it to collapse, forming a <em>geo</em>, a steep sided inlet into the side of the coast. Alternatively, the area below the crack or joint is undercut and a small <em>cave</em> will form. If the cave forms on a headland, then on the opposite side of the headland, a second cave can also begin to develop simultaneously. The water erodes the cave via corrosion and hydraulic action, flooding the cave and swilling around it, widening the cave and creating a unique pattern on the surface of the cave. As the two caves are eroded and cut into the headland, they will eventually meet. The resulting, iconic, landform is then referred to as an <em>arch</em>. The roof of the arch has no support however and is highly susceptible to weathering via exfoliation, salt crystallisation and biological weathering. As the weathering continues, the roof of the arch will collapse leaving a <em>stack</em>, a tall, lone piece of land sticking out in the sea. This stack is exposed to the full force of the water and is weathered and eroded heavily. The base of the stack receives a lot of erosion from hydraulic action and corrosion and, eventually, the stack will collapse into the sea leaving behind a small piece of land called a <em>stump</em>.</p>

<p>A blowhole forms in a cave. As a cave moves inland, the roof above it is weakened and as waves crash into the cave, they can be reflected upwards, eroding the roof of the cave. At the same time, weathering on the roof of the cave will help weaken it further and eventually water will be able to break through it, leaving a blowhole.</p>

<h2 id="barton-on-sea">Barton-on-Sea</h2>

<p>Barton-on-Sea and its cliffs are located in the south of England, just to the west of the Isle of Wight where it forms a coast with the English Channel. The section of the English Channel which it borders experiences strong winds and has a long fetch, resulting in a fairly fast rate of erosion on the cliffs. The rate of erosion is quickened by the geology of the cliffs, which are mainly composed of salt clay (also known as Barton Clay) and Barton sand in two layers. The combination of the long fetch and weak rocks is resulting in the rapid erosion and mass movement of sections of the cliff which is posing a risk to people and buildings along the stretch of coastline at Barton-on-Sea. </p>

<p>In order to prevent or reduce the risk of a cliff collapse, the local council has carried out several protective measures over the past few decades to try and slow cliff collapse. </p>

<h3 id="december-1993">December 1993</h3>

<p>There was a large cliff slip on the western front of Barton-on-Sea. In response to the collapse, more rock armour was placed by the cliffs to try and reduce the undercutting of them. </p>

<h3 id="september-2001">September 2001</h3>

<p>A collection of sea defences collapsed close to Cliff House. The collapse occurred as a rotational land slide in the Barton Clay formed a bulge in the lower section of the cliffs, which destroyed several drainage pipes. </p>

<h3 id="november-2003">November 2003</h3>

<p>After a period of heavy rainfall, a lot of water had saturated the cliffs and, while no collapse occurred, there was concern that the cliffs could collapse due to the observation of the movement of gravel. </p>

<h3 id="january-2007">January 2007</h3>

<p>Strong winter storms took place over the winter of 2006-2007, with an especially strong storm on the 18<sup>th</sup> of January. This resulted in the rapid erosion of the beach, where 60% of the sand and shingle was lost. The beaches had acted as a soft engineering technique to protect the cliffs and, as the beaches had been destroyed, a wooden retaining wall (from 1960) had been exposed and damaged which meant that the cliffs were very close to collapse. </p>

<p>In response to the damage, the council constructed a new stone wall using 600 tonnes of boulders to help protect the cliffs and rebuild the beach.</p>

<h3 id="april-2007">April 2007</h3>

<p>After extensive wet weather followed a period of dry weather, concern was again raised regarding the stability of the cliffs. There had been signs of cliff collapse in sections of the cliffs between Cliff House &amp; the Barton-on-Sea shopping area in the form of cracks in the gravel located at the top of the cliff. </p>

<p>The influence of a transnational corporation is great and there are few parts of both the developed and undeveloped world where the influence of a transnational corporation can not be felt. In the majority of countries, transnational corporations play a major role in the economy of the country and often have a lot of control over whether the economy is successful or unsuccessful. </p>

<h2 id="pharmaceutical-transnational-corporations">Pharmaceutical Transnational Corporations</h2>

<ul>
  <li>The largest ten pharmaceutical companies are among the top 400 companies in the world. One of the most famous pharmaceutical companies is GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) which employs 9650 people in over 100 countries and sell their products to 179 countries. GSK’s headquarters are distributed throughout MEDCs. There are 5 in the USA, 2 in Switzerland, 2 in the UK and 1 in France. </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="branded-drugs">Branded Drugs</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Medicines have two names, their generic names (normally the active ingredient) and then a brand name which the manufacturer trades the drug by. </li>
</ul>

<p>When a company discovers a new drug, it’s put through clinical trials in order to gain approval for marketing. If the trial shows that the drug is safe and effective, it’s approved and given a license. Given that testing generally takes 12 years and costs £500,000, the company that developed the drug holds the exclusive rights to the drug for 10 - 12 years in order to recuperate the money they spent on research and development. The drug company will market the drug under a brand name and the drug is protected from being developed by competitors by a patent. When the patent expires, other companies can produce the drug however they can only sell it under another brand name or its generic name. When other companies produce the drug, they can generally do so for less and sell the drug for less money since most of the research and development has already been done. Given that branded drugs are normally 3 - 30 times more expensive than their generic counterparts they are prohibitive to the majority of the world. Consumers of branded drugs generally have no choice but to purchase the branded drugs since the branded drugs are normally prescribed by doctors, at least in the UK. The drug industry infamously targets doctors with incentives to hand out prescriptions for branded drugs too. </p>

<ul>
  <li>While drug companies may seem to be money grabbing corporations, they do in fact bring important advances to societies. Drug companies provided numerous jobs and invest in society by paying taxes and investing in new, more advanced technologies. </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="essential-drugs">Essential Drugs</h3>

<ul>
  <li>The World Health Organisation (WHO) defines essential drugs as:</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Those drugs that satisfy the health care needs of the majority of the population; they should therefore be available at all times in adequate amounts and in appropriate dosage forms, at a price the community can afford.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This list of essential drugs is widely regarded as an important tool in increasing access for the world’s population to effective healthcare. </p>

<h3 id="drug-development">Drug Development</h3>

<ul>
  <li>The largest profits in the pharmaceutical industry come from the sale of branded drugs in developed countries. </li>
  <li>The most research money is spent on drugs to control <a href="/health-issues/coronary-heart-disease/">diseases of affluence</a>. </li>
  <li>Research into tropical diseases affecting hundreds of millions of people in less developed countries receives only a small proportion of the sum spent on cancer research.</li>
  <li>Many new drugs regarded by WHO as essential are not yet available in generic form. </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="glaxosmithkline">GlaxoSmithKline</h3>

<p>GlaxoSmithKline is the third largest pharmaceutical company in the world. Founded in London in 2000 (GlaxoWellcome is actually the original drug company, founded in 1880), the company has grown substantially and offers products for many diseases, especially diseases common to MEDCs such as diabetes and cancer. They also have treatments for viral diseases, mental health diseases and GlaxoSmithKline offers several over the counter products such as indigestion tablets. </p>

<p>The company’s headquarters are located in London, with more sub-headquarters spread around the world. GlaxoSmithKline has a presence in 99 cities across 39 countries. </p>

<p>While GlaxoSmithKline mainly targets more developed countries, the company has several programmes that help less developed countries. Since 2008, GlaxoSmithKline has been running trials of a vaccine against malaria, which would bring unprecedented benefits to most of the world, especially less developed countries. However the drug could end up being prohibitively expensive for less developed countries given its 25 years development period. Non the less, GlaxoSmithKline has made several pledges to try and bring its drugs to developing countries. The company has committed itself to lower the prices of its drugs in 50 of the least developed countries and to make its drugs more affordable to industrialising countries such as Brazil and India. In addition to this, all chemicals and processes that the company holds intellectual property rights to have been placed in a “patent pool” which will allow other companies to develop the drugs and improve upon them. </p>

<p>GlaxoSmithKline has numerous programmes within communities to help improve the health of those communities. Globally, GlaxoSmithKline provides disaster relief medicines. For example, after the events in Haiti GlaxoSmithKline committed £250,000 to the British Red Cross to fund a mass sanitation unit that prevents water born diseases from spreading. On a more local scale, GlaxoSmithKline provides services to local communities. Within the UK, GlaxoSmithKline has an independent living programme for young people living with disabilities. In the USA GlaxoSmithKline runs a programme to provide specialist care for homeless children. GlaxoSmithKline also runs educational programmes within the UK and USA to help develop an understanding of science issues and to encourage the young to take up careers in science.</p>

<h2 id="tobacco-transnational-corporations">Tobacco Transnational Corporations</h2>

<p>Tobacco transnational corporations are perhaps the largest and most powerful of transnational corporations playing major roles in many countries economies and health. </p>

<h3 id="british-american-tobacco">British American Tobacco</h3>

<p>British American Tobacco is one of the largest tobacco suppliers in the world. It sells its products in many countries, mainly targeting African, Indian &amp; Indonesian markets. It uses controversial advertising techniques to sell its products and there are strong accusations that it attempts to advertise and sell its products to young children in an attempt to get them addicted to tobacco. One of the alleged techniques is to sell single stick cigarettes in less developed countries, a practice which is frowned upon and illegal in many countries. These single stick cigarettes are far more accessible to young children with limited incomes who couldn’t afford a full pack of cigarettes and are an effective way of getting people hooked while they’re young. </p>

<p>The primary brands sold by British American Tobacco are Pall Mall and Embassy. The tobacco for these products is grown in warm equatorial environments and British American Tobacco will often employ the local population in the tobacco farming industry. British American Tobacco and other tobacco companies bring numerous advantages and disadvantages to the countries that they employ people in. One country that relies heavily on tobacco farming and tobacco transnational corporations is Malawi, a small landlocked nation located in the south of Africa. The advantages and disadvantages tobacco transnational corporations bring to Malawi are outline below:</p>

<h2 id="advantages">Advantages</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Tobacco farming provides a very large source of income for the country as a whole. Tobacco farming accounts for 2/3 of Malawi’s yearly income. </li>
  <li>Tobacco transnational corporations provide the people of Malawi with employment, stopping them from being forced to turn to crime. In Malawi, 75% of the population is dependent on tobacco farming in some way. The tobacco industry provides 1.7 million people with direct jobs and 5 million with indirect jobs relating to the tobacco industry in Malawi. </li>
  <li>Tobacco transnational corporations provide employment for women in many less developed countries which is very unusual and good progress towards developing women’s rights. </li>
  <li>Tobacco transnational corporations will often have ‘charitable givings’ where they provide clean water or health care to people in less developed countries. In Malawi, tobacco transnational corporations provide 40,000 people with clean water. </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="disadvantages">Disadvantages</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Children are often employed on tobacco farms despite this being illegal in Malawi and many other countries. This is unfair on the child as it takes them out of their education and prevents them from attaining better careers. </li>
  <li>Workers on the farm often die from tobacco poisoning including children.</li>
  <li>In Malawi, the high dependency on the tobacco companies means that if they were to leave the country, the people and the country would be without a reliable source of income. </li>
  <li>Due to the potential profitability of tobacco farming, many farmers choose to grow tobacco instead of food leading to famines within countries were tobacco farming is popular. </li>
  <li>The pay for tobacco farmers is very low since the farmers often have to take out huge loans from the tobacco companies to run farms. </li>
  <li>Tobacco farming acts as propaganda and increases the likelihood of people smoking in a country. </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="health-implications-of-smoking">Health Implications Of Smoking</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Smoking is the second major cause of death in the world. It causes 90% of the deaths from lung cancer; 80% of the deaths from bronchitis &amp; emphysema; 17% of deaths from heart disease and a third of all cancer deaths. </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="reducing-the-impacts-of-smoking">Reducing The Impacts Of Smoking</h2>

<p>In the UK, many government lead programmes have been carried out in order to reduce smoking in the country. Some of these programmes include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Advertisement campaigns featuring shocking and graphic scenes relating to the risks of smoking aired during prime time TV.</li>
  <li>A ban on the sale of cigarettes to under 18s. </li>
  <li>All cigarettes must be kept behind a counter and away from public view. </li>
  <li>Vending machines that dispense cigarettes are illegal.</li>
  <li>Public smoking is banned except for in designated areas. </li>
  <li>Cigarette packaging must be generic and plain and must feature large warnings about the risks of smoking. </li>
  <li>The NHS offers free stop smoking clinics. </li>
</ul>

<p>The Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCFC) is an international agreement that outlines the minimum standards on tobacco e.g. advertising bans. The framework was signed by most countries but, noticeably, the USA and Indonesia did not sign. </p>

                <content type="html"><![CDATA[ <h3 id="why-are-some-areas-of-brazil-densely-populated">Why are some areas of Brazil Densely Populated?</h3>

<p>Rural to urban migration is resulting in very dense populations in major cities. People migrate in order to find jobs and better living standards but, as a result of the dense population, employment and services are lacking. Some rural areas are also densely populated since they provide employment in mines and in the rainforest. The existence of shanty towns are also encouraging dense populations as shanty towns allow lots of cheap low quality housing to be packed into a small area which results in lots of immigrants living in the area as the housing is cheap.</p>

<h3 id="why-are-some-areas-sparsely-populated">Why Are Some Areas Sparsely Populated?</h3>

<p>The north east of Brazil is very sparsely populated due to the climate of the area. The north east suffers from frequent droughts which means many people have moved out of the area in search of better jobs and prospects as well as a more equable climate. In addition, many areas of Brazil have only recently received access to infrastructure. Western Amazona, for example, only received good infrastructure in 1960 when the Trans Amazonia highway was built. As a result, this area is relatively sparsely populated since it’s relatively undeveloped and people could have a lack of employment and services in the area.</p>

<h3 id="how-might-distribution-change">How Might Distribution Change?</h3>

<p>Distribution towards the west of Brazil may begin to increase in density over time, especially in Amazona thanks to improved infrastructure in the area. The construction of the Trans Amazonian Highway in 1960 has already influenced the population density in the area with a small area going from 2 - 25 people per km<sup>2</sup> to over 25 between 1970 and 1990. The construction of the highway will make it easier for people to access the area paving the way for new serves and businesses making the area more attractive for people to live in and therefore increasing the population density in the area. In addition the Brazilian government is encouraging the development of central Brazil by promoting agricultural urbanisation and setting up a new capital city, Brasilia. The creation of a capital city will help increase the density in the area greatly since the capital will be a central economic point and therefore may have lots of business in the area making it attractive to live there for employment and so increasing the density in the area. </p>

                <content type="html"><![CDATA[ <p>Sub-aerial processes are land based processes which alter the shape of a coastline. They’re a combination of both <a href="#weathering">weathering</a> and <a href="#mass-movement">mass movement</a>. </p>

<h2 id="weathering">Weathering</h2>

<h3 id="freeze-thaw">Freeze Thaw</h3>

<p>Freeze thaw weathering involves water entering cracks in rocks and freezing. When the water freezes it expands, fracturing the rock. </p>

<h3 id="exfoliation">Exfoliation</h3>

<p>The repeated action of heating and cooling rocks causing them to “shed” off layers. </p>

<h3 id="biological-weathering">Biological Weathering</h3>

<p>Plant seeds get into cracks in rocks and begin growing. As they grow, they exert pressure on the rocks, causing them to fracture. Seaweed, under the sea, can attach itself to rocks so that, as the sea moves the seaweed, chunks of rock are pulled away. </p>

<h3 id="chemical-weathering">Chemical Weathering</h3>

<p><a href="/coasts/coastal-erosion/#corrosion">Corrosion</a> is <em>technically</em> a form of weathering and not erosion. Processes such as hydrolysis and oxidation can weather away rocks. Hydrolysis involves the splitting of minerals due to their reactivity with water. Oxidation is, basically, rusting. Elements such as iron are susceptible to oxidation and can be found within minerals on coastlines. </p>

<h2 id="mass-movement">Mass Movement</h2>

<p>Mass movement can be defined as the large scale movement of weathered material in response to gravity. Essentially, it’s when a cliff or other structure that is not horizontally orientated has been weathered to the point at which it starts to collapse. There’s five types of mass movement: rockfall, soil creep, landslides, mudflow and slumping.</p>

<h3 id="rockfalls">Rockfalls</h3>

<p>Freeze thaw weathering on a cliff breaks the rocks up into smaller pieces which can then free fall. This occurs commonly on cliffs with lots of joints as the joints make it easier to break up the rock. If the cliff is undercut by the sea, it can loose some of its stability, increasing the likelihood that a rockfall will occur. </p>

<h3 id="soil-creep">Soil Creep</h3>

<p>Soil creep is an incredibly slow process. It occurs on very gentle slopes and produces an undulated (wavy) surface. Damp soil moves very slowly down hill due to the increase in its mass (since it’s wet). </p>

<h3 id="landslides">Landslides</h3>

<p>After being soaked by water, cliffs made from soft rock will begin to slip due to the rock being lubricated. Landslides are very similar to slumps. </p>

<h3 id="rotational-slumping">(Rotational) Slumping</h3>

<p>Slumping happens for similar reasons to landslides. Heavy rainfall makes the rock heavier due to it absorbing the water and the water also acts as a lubricant. The difference with slumping is that it happens on a concave surface, which causes the cliff to form a crescent shape. </p>

<h3 id="mudflow">Mudflow</h3>

<p>Mudflow is a very dangerous form of mass movement which occurs on steep slopes with saturated soil and little vegetation. The lack of vegetation means that there is nothing to bind the soil together, promoting mass wasting. The saturated soil becomes heavier and is lubricated, leading to the rapid movement of a lot of mud downhill. </p>

                <content type="html"><![CDATA[ <p>Rejuvenation occurs when the river’s base level falls (i.e. when sea level falls). This can be a consequence of either a fall in the amount of sea water or the land rising. Both are the result of the comings and goings of ice ages. The effect on rivers is to produce features called “knick points” (which can be seen as waterfalls and rapids), river terraces and incised meanders. </p>

<h2 id="features-of-rejuvenation">Features Of Rejuvenation</h2>

<h3 id="incised-meanders">Incised Meanders</h3>

<p>Incised meanders are meanders which are particularly well developed and occur when a river’s base level has fallen giving the river a large amount of vertical erosion power, allowing it to downcut. There are two types of incised meanders, <em>entrenched</em> meanders and <em>ingrown</em> meanders. entrenched meanders are symmetrical and form when the river downcuts particularly quickly. Due to the speed which the river downcuts, there is little opportunity for lateral erosion to occur giving them their symmetrical shape. Ingrown meanders are asymmetrical. They form when the river downcuts at a less rapid pace, giving the river opportunity to erode laterally as well as vertically.</p>

<h3 id="river-terraceshttpenwikipediaorgwikiriverterrace"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/River_terrace">River Terraces</a></h3>

<p>A rejuvenating river can erode vertically into the former flood plain to produce features called river terraces. If vertical erosion is rapid then <em>paired</em> terraces are formed either side of the channel. If vertical erosion is slower though, <em>unpaired</em> terraces form as the river is given opportunity to meander.  River terraces are particularly useful for settlements as they provide flat areas above the present floodplain. Oxford, Cambridge and London all developed on the river terraces of the Isis, Cam and Thames respectively.</p>

<p>The population density of the UK is 246 people per km<sup>2</sup>. This makes the UK the third densest country in the EU with the Netherlands taking the number one spot with a density of 395 people per km<sup>2</sup>. The UK is nine time denser than the US, which has a density of just 27 people per km<sup>2</sup>. Compared with Bangladesh however (density 1,002 people per km<sup>2</sup>), the UK appears fairly sparsely populated.</p>

<h3 id="patterns-of-population-distribution-in-the-uk">Patterns Of Population Distribution In The UK</h3>

<p>The population of the UK is incredibly dense near major cities such as London, Portsmouth and Liverpool. The density is at least 200 people per km<sup>2</sup> near these cities. Outside these areas the density generally varies between 11 to 100 people per km<sup>2</sup>. In central Wales and most of Scotland the population density is incredibly low though, with a density of 1-10 people per km<sup>2</sup>. </p>

<h3 id="disadvantages-of-a-dense-population">Disadvantages of A Dense Population</h3>

<p>Very dense populations put a strain on resources such as food and water. They also put strain on social services such as healthcare. Very dense populations cause housing shortages and often result in the development of shanty towns or alternatively, many high rise apartments. Dense populations increase noise and air pollution since there is a lot of human activity. They also increase congestion as a result of the mass of people using cars. </p>

<h3 id="advantages-of-a-dense-population">Advantages of A Dense Population.</h3>

<p>A dense population ensures that 100% of available resources are used by a  city. As a result, the efficiency in which these resources are used tends to increase to reduce costs which can ultimately end up benefiting the environment since people become less wasteful with resources. </p>

<h3 id="why-are-some-areas-of-the-uk-densely-populated">Why Are Some Areas Of The UK Densely Populated?</h3>

<p>Liverpool is very densely populated largely due to its use as a port. Since it’s a port it makes the area favourable as a place for immigrants. It also means that industry will build close to the port and, as a result, workers will move closer to the industry increasing Liverpool’s density. Access to good infrastructure in the area makes it an attractive place to live and work and the construction of the Liverpool One shopping centre increased the commercial industry in the area providing jobs and making it more attractive for people to live there.</p>

<h3 id="why-are-some-areas-of-the-uk-sparsely-populated">Why Are Some Areas Of The UK Sparsely Populated?</h3>

<p>Most of Scotland is sparsely populated sans a few major cities. This is likely due to the high relief in the area which makes development of good infrastructure hard and so discourages the development of industry in the area making the area unattractive due to a shortage of jobs. In addition, the cold climate would make living in the area hard and, combined with a poor infrastructure, receiving supplies in the winter challenging making it dangerous to live in the area and so reducing the population density.</p>

<h3 id="reasons-why-distribution-might-change">Reasons why distribution might change</h3>

<p>Immigration is a major factor effecting distribution. Immigrants tend to head towards large cities as that’s where work is which results in these areas becoming densely populated. Counter urbanisation is also a major factor effecting population density. Increasingly, people are moving to rural areas which, in turn, is causing an increase in the population density of these areas. An ageing population also plays a substantial role. Retired folk favour living in coastal areas and, as a result of Britain’s increasingly ageing population, these coastal areas may receive an influx of old people resulting in an increase in population density in these areas. Finally, the redevelopment of areas can cause a decrease in the population density of an area since the demolition of high rise buildings in favour of terraced housing reduces the number of people who can live in an area. Conversely, the demolition of small houses in favour of high rise building can cause an increase in the population density. </p>

                <content type="html"><![CDATA[ <h2 id="potholes">Potholes</h2>

<p>Potholes are cylindrical holes drilled into the bed of a river. They vary in diameter from just a few centimetres to several metres and the largest potholes are several metres deep. Potholes form when pebbles become trapped in small hollows and vertical eddies (a circular current of water counter to the flow of the river) develop, drilling the pebble into the bed and eroding the bed by corrasion, producing a hole that grows as the pebble erodes it. In order for the pebble to erode the bed the pebble needs to be <em>at least</em> as hard as the rock that makes up the river bed, if not harder otherwise it won’t have any effect and instead the pebble will be eroded. </p>

<p>Potholes are features found mainly in the upper course of the river as this is where the river has the most gravitational potential energy and so the greatest ability to erode vertically. In addition, the river is more turbulent in the upper course so it is more likely to create the eddies needed to drill the pebbles into the bed.</p>

<h2 id="v-shaped-valleys">V-Shaped Valleys</h2>

<p>V-Shaped valleys are found in the upper course of the river and are a result of both erosion by the river and weathering. V-Shaped valleys are deep river valleys with steep sides that look like a letter V when a cross section of them is taken, hence the name. They’re found in the upper course because this is where the river has the greatest gravitational potential energy and so the greatest potential to erode vertically. It does so during periods of high discharge. When the river’s discharge is high, it is able to transport its large bedload by traction eroding the river’s bed and valley by corrasion, deepening it. Not much lateral erosion takes place so the channel and valley remains relatively narrow. </p>

<p>As the channel and valley deepens the sides of the valley are exposed and become susceptible to weathering. The valley’s sides also undergo mass movements resulting in large volumes of material falling into the river’s channel, adding to its erosive power and causing the valley sides to take up a V shape. The steepness of the valley sides and whether the valley actually looks like a V is dependent on the climate, vegetation and rock structure among things. In cold, wet climates, freeze thaw weathering is abundant and rainwater can act as a lubricant, aiding mass movements. Vegetation can impede mass movements because it will help bind the soil. If the valley is composed of hard rock the valley sides will be very steep because they won’t be weathered easily.</p>

<h2 id="waterfalls-geological">Waterfalls (Geological)</h2>

<p>Waterfalls develop when a change of lithology takes place in the river’s course resulting in differential erosion taking place. When the rock type of the river’s channel changes from hard rock to soft rock, the river erodes the soft rock faster than the hard rock (differential erosion) producing a sudden drop in the gradient of the river with the hard rock being higher up than the soft rock. As the river flows over the hard rock, it falls onto the soft rock with a considerable amount of force, eroding the soft rock and creating a greater height difference between the hard and soft rock, producing the waterfall. As the water flows over the waterfall, it carves out a <em>plunge pool</em> via corrasion and erodes &amp; undercuts the hard rock via a process called <em>splashback</em>. As the hard rock is undercut, a cap rock is produced. This is a chunk of hard rock that the river flows over before flowing over the waterfall that is unsupported as it has been undercut by splashback. The cap rock is unstable and will eventually collapse into the plunge pool causing the waterfall to retreat. Over thousands of years, the repeated process of the collapse of a cap rock and the retreat of the waterfall produces a <em>gorge of recession</em>.</p>

<h2 id="rapids">Rapids</h2>

<p>Rapids are sections of a river where the gradient of the river bed is relatively steep resulting in an increase in the river’s turbulence and velocity. They form where the gradient of the river is steep and the bed is composed mainly of hard rocks. </p>

<h2 id="meanders">Meanders</h2>

<p>Meanders are bends in a river that form as a river’s sinuosity increases. The sinuosity of a river is a measurement of how much a river varies from a straight line. It’s a ratio between the channel length and displacement (straight line distance) between two points in the river’s course:</p>

<p>\[ \text{Sinuosity} = \frac{\text{Channel Length}}{\text{Displacement}} \]</p>

<p>A sinuosity of 1 means that the channel is perfectly straight. A sinuosity greater than 1 means that the river meanders.</p>

<p>Meanders develop when alternating riffles &amp; pools form along a river channel. A riffle is a a shallow section of a channel while a pool is a deep section. These riffles and pools develop at equal points along the river channel with each pool being about 5× the length of the channel. </p>

<p>In a pool, the channel is more efficient while at a riffle, the channel is less efficient. This causes the flow of the river to become irregular and the maximum flow is concentrated on one side of the river. This increases erosion on one side of the river and increases deposition on the other causing the river’s channel to appear to bend. Erosion is greatest on the outside bend and deposition is greatest on the inside bend.</p>

<p><img src="/Images/rivers/riffles-and-pools.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The alternating riffles &amp; pools have another affect, they increase the turbulence of the river and produce a special type  of flow known as <em>helicoidal</em> flow. This is a corkscrew like movement which spirals from one side of the channel to another between pools. The helicoidal flow erodes the pools along the channel and increases deposition on the next inside bend after a pool. </p>

<h3 id="characteristics">Characteristics</h3>

<p>A cross section of a meander would show that on the outside bend, the channel is very deep and concave. This is because the outside bend is where the river flows fastest and is most energetic, so lots of erosion by hydraulic action and corrasion takes place. <em>River cliffs</em> form on the outside bend as the river erodes laterally. The inside bend is shallower with a gentle <em>slip-off slope</em> made of sand or shingle that is brought across from the outside bend by the helicoidal flow of the river. The river flows much slower on the inside bend so some deposition takes place, contribution to the slip-off slope. </p>

<h2 id="braided-channels">Braided Channels</h2>

<p>A braided channel is a type of channel that is divided into smaller sub-channels by small, temporary islands called <em>eyots</em>. Braided channels develop in rivers with a lot of sedimentary load, a steep gradient and where the discharge of the river changes regularly. When the volume of load exceeds the river’s capacity or the discharge of the river drops, the river is forced to deposit its load in the channel and islands of sediment (eyots) form.</p>

<h2 id="floodplains">Floodplains</h2>

<p>Floodplains are large, flat expanses of land that form on either side of a river. The floodplain is the area that a river floods onto when it’s experiencing high discharge. When a river floods, its efficiency decreases rapidly because of an increase in friction, reducing the river’s velocity and forcing it to deposit its load. The load is deposited across the floodplain as <em>alluvium</em>. The alluvium is very fertile so floodplains are often used as farmland. </p>

<p>The width of a floodplain is determined by the sinuosity of the river and how much meander migration takes place. If there’s a lot of meander migration, the area that the river floods on will change and the floodplain will become wider.</p>

<h2 id="levees">Levees</h2>

<p>Levees are natural embankments produced, ironically, when a river floods. When a river floods, it deposits its load over the flood plain due to a dramatic drop in the river’s velocity as friction increases greatly. The largest &amp; heaviest load is deposited first and closest to the river bank, often on the very edge, forming raised mounds. The finer material is deposited further away from the banks causing the mounds to appear to taper off. Repeated floods cause the mounds to build up and form levees. </p>

<p>Levees aren’t permanent structures. Once the river’s discharge exceeds its bankfull discharge<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup>, the levees can be burst by the high pressure of the water. Levees increase the height of the river’s channel though, so the bankfull discharge is increased and it becomes more difficult for the river to flood. </p>

<p><img src="/Images/rivers/levee-diagram.png" alt="" /></p>

<h2 id="oxbow-lakes">Oxbow Lakes</h2>

<p>Oxbow lakes develop from meanders that have undergone extensive deposition. The neck of a meander gradually narrows as a result of deposition on the inside bend. During periods of high discharge, a river will break across a meander’s neck so that it can take the fastest route until discharge returns to normal levels. Over time, the neck of the meander will narrow until the meander is blocked off by deposition causing the river to assume a new, straighter course and leaving the remains of the meander as an oxbow lake. Ultimately, the lake will dry up and a <em>meander scar</em> will be all that is left.</p>

<p><img src="/Images/rivers/oxbow-lake-formation-diagram.png" alt="" /></p>

<h2 id="deltas">Deltas</h2>

<p>Deltas are depositional landforms found at the mouth of a river where the river meets a body of water with a lower velocity than the river (e.g. a lake or the sea). The body of water must be relatively quiet and stable with a low tidal range so that deposited sediment isn’t washed away and can instead build up. </p>

<p>When a river meets a stationary body of water, its velocity falls causing any material being transported by the river to be deposited. Deltas are made up of three sediment beds that have been sorted by the size of the sediment. The bottom most bed, the <em>bottomset</em> bed, is composed primarily of clay and fine grained sediments because when clay meets salt water a process called flocculation takes place where clay &amp; salt particles clump together (flocculate) due to an electrostatic charge developing between the particles. This makes the clay particles sink due to their increased weight producing the bottomset bed. The bottomset bed stretches a fair distance from the mouth of the river as the fine sediments can be transported a reasonable distance from the river’s mouth.</p>

<p>The foreset bed is the next bed that develops on top of the bottomset bed. The foreset bed is composed of coarser sediments that are deposited due to a fall in the river’s velocity and aren’t transported very far into the stationary body of water that the river flows into. The foreset bed makes up the majority of the delta and is dipped towards deep water in the direction that the river is flowing in. </p>

<p>The topset bed is the topmost bed of the delta. It is also composed of coarse sediment but, unlike the foreset bed, the topset bed isn’t dipped and is purely horizontal.</p>

<p><img src="/Images/rivers/delta-bedding-layers.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Deltas can take on many different shapes. The three primary shapes of delta are <em>cuspate</em>, <em>arcuate</em> and <em>bird’s foot</em>.</p>

<p>Arcuate deltas (e.g. The Nile Delta, Egypt) are shaped like a triangle (which is where the term delta comes from, the Greek letter delta Δ) and form when a river meets a sea with alternating current directions that shape the delta so that it looks like a triangle.</p>

<p><img src="/Images/rivers/nile-delta-gmap.png" alt="The Nile Delta" /></p>

<p>Cuspate deltas (e.g. Ebro Delta, Spain) are vaguely shaped like a V with curved sides. Cuspate deltas form when a river flows into a sea with waves that hit it head on, spreading the deposited sediment out.</p>

<p><img src="/Images/rivers/ebro-delta-gmap.png" alt="The Ebro Delta" /></p>

<p>Bird’s foot deltas (e.g. The Mississippi Delta) are shaped like (as the name suggests) a bird’s foot. They extend reasonably far into a body of water and form when the river’s current is stronger than the sea’s waves. Bird’s foot deltas are uncommon because there are very few areas where a sea’s waves are weaker than a river’s current. </p>

                <content type="html"><![CDATA[ <p><em>Malnutrition</em> is a condition resulting from a dietary deficiency, such as a lack of access to a specific nutrient or due to a lack of access to food in general. </p>

<p><em>Undernourishment</em> is simply when people consume too little food over a certain period of time.</p>

<h2 id="famine">Famine</h2>

<h3 id="causes">Causes</h3>

<ul>
  <li><em>Drought</em> - A lack of rainfall leads to a lack of water in the water table for plants. This can result in crops failing and the death of livestock, leading to food shortages, primarily for subsistence farmers, but in more extreme cases whole countries. </li>
  <li><em>Disease</em> - A spread of disease through crops can quickly eliminate a years harvest leading to mass famine.</li>
  <li><em>Population Increase</em> - If the population of an area increases too quickly, perhaps due to an influx of refugees, the food supplies may not be able to scale to the demand, leading to a famine. </li>
  <li><em>Cost</em> - When the quantity of available food and livestock falls, the demand and hence cost of food increases. As food prices inflate, people become unable to afford food and begin to starve. </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="famine-in-ethiopia">Famine in Ethiopia</h2>

<h3 id="location">Location</h3>

<p>Ethiopia itself is located in the east of Africa to the south of the country of Eritrea, north of Kenya. The area is landlocked due to Eritrea splitting off during a civil war. The areas affected by the civil war include Eritrea and Tiya, where the civil war has been taking place. Refugees from the civil war in these areas have fled to Koram, which hosted the majority of the famished during a famine in 1984. More recently, a drought in Ethiopia has led to famine in Gode, in the south of Ethiopia. </p>

<h3 id="when">When</h3>

<ul>
  <li>The initial famines due to civil war and drought were in 1984 - 1985. </li>
  <li>Famines occurred again in 2000 due to drought. </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="cause">Cause</h3>

<ul>
  <li>In all cases, drought led to the failure of crops which resulted in famines. In 2000 and 1984-1985 there had been poor rainfall for 3 years. This causes crops to fail and also forced herdsman to slaughter their cattle. The slaughtering of cattle was unusual, since the cattle are generally used for milking, not for meat. </li>
  <li>The lack of rain was due to cooler sea temperatures in the Atlantic &amp; Pacific, so less evaporation occurred and hence less rain fell. </li>
  <li>A civil war between Ethiopia and Eritrea had been waged for several years and made it difficult to get food into Ethiopia, including aid, since Ethiopia is landlocked and Eritrea was the only country to have access to a port. In addition, it soon emerged that some of the aid that had been sent over to Ethiopia had been used to feed Ethiopian soldiers and the vehicles used to transport the aid were used for military use. </li>
  <li>The population of Ethiopia had grown exponentially by 2000 meaning there was too little food to feed the population. </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="effects">Effects</h3>

<ul>
  <li>In the 1984 famine, 40,000 refugees in Koran were at risk of starving. Of the 40,000 people, some 15,000 children were effected by the famine. A third of these children were severely malnourished.</li>
  <li>In the 1984 famine, 1 person died every 20 minutes due to undernourishment. </li>
  <li>During the 2000 famine, 95% of the livestock had been killed either due to the drought or by their herdsmen, desperate for food. </li>
  <li>1 million people were killed in both famines. </li>
  <li>The price of food during the 2000 famine rose greatly due to the mass migration of farmers and livestock in search of water and fresh ground. This put substantial pressure on places where there wasn’t enough water and pasture, leading to more deaths.</li>
  <li>Due to the killing of cattle that were intended to be used for milk, milk became scarce leading to malnutrition, especially in pregnant women and children. </li>
  <li>The 2000 famine effected 43% of the population.</li>
  <li>The conditions of the refugee camps and the presence of malnourishment in them led to the spread of diseases such as TB. </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="responses">Responses</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Initially, multiple non government organisations such as Oxfam and Doctors Without Borders attempted to provide aid for those in need. Eventually, international governments became involved in providing aid. </li>
  <li>Live Aid was immensely successful at raising awareness and money for the famine and was responsible for getting governments involved in providing aid to Ethiopia. </li>
  <li>An early warning system was setup to predict poor rainfall so that food and aid can be acquired in preparation. </li>
  <li>Since the 1984 drought, the government holds 350,000 (metric) tonnes of food in reserve in the of a drought. The resources are supposed to be replenished as soon as they are used but during the 2000 drought, the reserves fell to 50,000 tonnes without being replaced. </li>
  <li>Donations of clothing and dry food from the west. </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="problems-with-responses">Problems With Responses</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Aid wasn’t well distributed. The poor infrastructure of Ethiopia and its landlocked nature made getting aid into the country hard. </li>
  <li>When Ethiopia appealed for aid, the world didn’t respond with aid due to other problems in the world and reports that donated money was going into the army rather than towards food.</li>
  <li>Medical workers were killed due to the ongoing civil war. </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="issues-relating-to-famine">Issues relating to Famine</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Over dependence on aid by countries can result in a worsened situation and damage to the agricultural economy. </li>
  <li>Disaster fatigue, were people become tired of donating money or want to do more to help than donating money but can’t. </li>
  <li>Coordination between aid agencies and governments can fall apart during crisis resulting wasted aid and more deaths.</li>
  <li>Any food sent must be non-perishable, easily transported and of local tastes. During the 1984 famine in Ethiopia, a stupid mistake meant people sent powdered milk to a country suffering from <strong>drought</strong>. Powdered milk requires water.  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="obesity">Obesity</h2>

<ul>
  <li><em>Obesity</em> is the excessive gain of weight to the point at which it impairs health. It is generally caused when the total calorie (and hence energy) intake is greater than the calorie (energy) output. </li>
  <li><em>BMI</em> is a weight to height ratio that is used to determine when a person is overweight, underweight or obese. It is calculated using:</li>

<p>These BMI categories are not applicable for children. </p>

<p>Obesity is a global issue and is especially prevalent in MEDCs, more so in women. In the USA, 45% of the female population is obese. Throughout Europe, Argentina &amp; Russia, 30-45% of the female population is obese. Conversely for men, in the USA, 30-45% of the male population is obese while in Europe and Australia the obesity levels stand at 15-29% of the male population. Russia has an obesity rate of 8-14.9% among its males. Finally, 8% of the male population is obese in nearly all of Africa, India, China &amp; Japan. </p>

<h2 id="obesity-statistics">Obesity Statistics</h2>

<ul>
  <li>1.4 billion people in the world are overweight of which over 500 million are obese.</li>
  <li>In the USA, 35% of children are obese. </li>
</ul>

<p>Within the UK, obesity is becoming a major problem. In 2010, nearly 70% of the population was overweight or obese and the National Health Service predicts that 27,000 deaths per year are caused by complications relating to the prevalence of diabetes, a disease commonly associated with obesity. The most common group of people effected by obesity are the poor, working class as they can’t afford healthy food which is more expensive than processed food and has a far shorter shelf life. </p>

<p>Childhood obesity is also on the rise within the UK, largely due to a dramatic decrease in the activity levels of children. Significantly less children walk to school now than did two to three decades ago. In addition, the majority of children now watch about a days worth of television each weak so they are no longer very active. The TV they watch is also stuffed full of adverts for unhealthy foods that are specifically targeted at children. </p>

<p>The UK government runs the Change 4 Life programme, an attempt to get families more active and eating healthier food. Other programmes include a programme to encourage children to walk to school rather than taking a car or bus to make them more active and to help the environment. The London 2012 olympics have also sparked an interest throughout the UK in sports again and the UK government has launched several programmes to take advantage of the hype surrounding the Olympics. </p>

<h2 id="causes--consequences-of-obesity">Causes &amp; Consequences Of Obesity</h2>

<p>In the past 4 decades, obesity levels have risen greatly throughout the world. This is largely due to the increase in high calorie foods that are consumed. People are consuming more food that is high in calories, sugar and fat. Coupled with this is the fact that people are becoming less active thanks to the less active forms of work that people now engage in. The availability of powered transport and desk jobs have significantly reduced people’s activity. </p>

<p>The health risks of obesity are substantial. As the BMI of an individual increases, the health issues that they are at risk of also increase. The risk of coronary heart disease is substantially increased for the obese. Further more, people are more at risk at contracting several types of cancers, osteoarthritis and diabetes. Diabetes is now considered a global epidemic by the WHO who predict that deaths from diabetes will increase by 50% within the next ten years. </p>

<p>In addition to these health issues, obesity has several non health related problems too. Vehicles have to be designed to seat large people, extra wide clothing, doors, even coffins are in high demand. Airliners, for example, must now reconsider the luggage weight of passengers as the increasing weight of people is becoming problematic for flying. </p>

<p>Within countries where malnutrition is present, many people are also over weight, often within individual families as other members of the family are starved in order to feed the obese individuals. </p>

<h2 id="limiting--reducing-obesity">Limiting &amp; Reducing Obesity</h2>

<p>In nearly all cases it’s possible to prevent obesity from happening in a person and, once a person is obese, it is possible (but difficult) for them to loose weight and achieve a “normal” weight again. The best way to reduce and limit obesity is to monitor food intake. Reducing sugar intake, fat intake and limiting calorie intake to the sufficient amount will help reduce obesity greatly. Planning diets so that only the necessary amount of food is consumed will help reduce obesity. In addition to managing food intake, increasing exercise will also help reduce obesity. Carrying out regular exercise will balance out the calories consumed, preventing obesity from developing. </p>

<p>Reducing obesity is backed by many organisations including governments, charities and the food industry itself. Government led initiatives to help reduce obesity within a country have proven to be successful. A common technique is to introduce changes to education programmes within schools so that there is more of a focus on healthy eating and exercise, either by increasing the importance of these topics within subjects or by altering school meals and increasing the amount of mandatory exercise per week in schools. Government led initiatives for adults are more limited. In the UK, the Change 4 Life programme has attempted to improve the health of both children and adults with a particularly family orientated nature. Food companies have attempted to improve the healthiness of their food by reducing the salt, fat, saturated fat and sugar levels within their foods. They have been motivated to do this due to government programmes were healthy foods receive far more publicity and more attractive marketing terms than unhealthy foods. </p>

<h3 id="coping-with-obesity-in-brazil">Coping With Obesity In Brazil</h3>

<p>Brazil implemented several different laws to try and reduce obesity within the country before it developed to too high levels. The government led Family Health Programme helps to raise awareness of different exercise programmes and healthy food choices. In addition, the government closely monitors obesity trends within adults and children to attempt to prevent any increases in obesity before it actually happens. Food advertising laws mean that foods that receive TV time or space in a newspaper and are high in fat and sugar have to put warning signs within the advert to alert consumers of the potential health risks (similar to the health warnings found on cigarette packets). </p>

                <content type="html"><![CDATA[ <h3 id="hydraulic-action">Hydraulic Action</h3>

<p>Also known as <em>wave quarrying</em>, when a wave breaks onto a cliff, it traps a large amount of air behind it. The air is forced into cracks in the cliff with an immense amount of pressure. When the water retreats, the air is released from the cracks and a miniature explosive decompression takes place, weakening the cliff. Over time, the cliff can be weakened to the point at which a small storm will be enough to cause it to collapse. </p>

<h3 id="corrasionabrasion">Corrasion/Abrasion</h3>

<p>Sand, shingle and boulders picked up by waves act as sandpaper on other rocks causing them to be ground away and eroded over time. The material that the waves pick up can also be thrown up against cliffs, causing extensive damage due to the force of the rocks impacting the cliff. </p>

<h3 id="attrition">Attrition</h3>

<p>Beach material is eroded as a result of rocks and pebbles constantly hitting each other in the water. The material is worn down into more circular pieces. </p>

<h3 id="corrosion">Corrosion</h3>

<p>Many coastal rocks are susceptible to corrosion by salt water. Limestone coasts are susceptible to carbonation, where limestone is dissolved by carbonic acid in the sea. This process depends on the saturation of the sea however as if it contains too much calcium carbonate (CaCo<sub>3</sub>), carbonation won’t occur. </p>

<p>While this isn’t strictly a form of erosion, the pressure of sea salt on rocks can also be considered a form of erosion. When sea water evaporates, the salt in it remains on the rocks and crystallises. The crystallisation causes the salt to expand and become heavier, straining the rocks and eventually causing them to fracture. </p>

<h2 id="factors-effecting-the-rate-of-erosion">Factors Effecting The Rate Of Erosion</h2>

<ul>
  <li>The geology of the coast is very important. Limestone coasts will be more easily eroded, while coasts made from harder rock types will be eroded much more slowly. </li>
  <li>The size of the fetch will effect coastal erosion as a long fetch will produce stronger waves with more energy allowing them to do more damage via hydraulic action. </li>
  <li>The <a href="/coasts/waves/#constructive--destructive-waves">wave type</a> effects the type of beach present and hence the erosion of the coast as different shaped beaches dissipate wave energy at different rates. </li>
  <li>The type of beach (sand or shingle), which itself effects the shape of the beach.</li>
  <li>Beaches help to absorb the energy of waves and reduce the effect of erosion on the coast. Steep beaches dissipate the energy of waves well and more gradual beaches have the effect of spreading the energy out. </li>
  <li>Rock structure/geology/lithology.</li>
  <li>Shape of the coastline.</li>
  <li>Wave refraction.</li>
  <li>Humans play an important role in the erosion of coasts. Humans often construct sea defences which can reduce erosion in a certain area. However, these defences can have the knock-on effect of increasing erosion in other areas. Humans can also remove natural defences, which can in turn increase erosion in an area. The removal or alteration of beaches can increase erosion of a coast.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="lithology">Lithology</h2>

<p><em>Lithology</em> is a term used to describe the properties of a rock, such as it’s resistance to erosion. A coast whose lithology is composed of granite will be eroded very slowly, while a coast whose lithology is composed of limestone will be eroded far more quickly. An important consideration regarding the lithology of a coast is how the different types of rocks are arranged. When different layers of rocks are arranged parallel to each other, a concordant coastline is formed whereas when the different layers are at right angles to the coastline, a discordant coastline is formed. </p>

<h2 id="dip">Dip</h2>

<p>The stability and steepness of a cliff is dependent on the <em>dip</em> of its bedding layers. Beds which dip towards the sea produce gentle cliffs which are unstable. Beds which dip away from the sea or are horizontal produce steep, stable cliffs. </p>

<p><img src="/Images/coasts/5coastalErosion/horizontalBeddingLayersDiagram.png" alt="A cliff with horizontal bedding layers." /></p>

<p>The above cliff has horizontal bedding layers with no dip. This causes the cliff to be steep and stable. The same sort of cliff would be produced if the bed layers dipped away from the sea.</p>

                <content type="html"><![CDATA[ <p>The location which waves break at is determined by the state of the tide. The level of the tide (and the sea level) over short time periods is, itself, determined by the combined gravitational affects of the Sun and Moon. The Sun and Moon exert a gravitational pull on the Earth with the moon having the bigger influence due to its proximity to the Earth despite the Moon obviously being less massive (and therefore gravitationally weaker) than the Sun. The Moon is able to pull water on the Earth towards it creating a bulge which is known as the high tide. As the moon orbits the Earth, the high tide follows it. There are two high tides a day, one when the moon is “in line” and another 12 hours and 25 minutes later, when the moon is on the other side of the Earth.</p>

<h2 id="tidal-range">Tidal Range</h2>

<p>The <em>tidal range</em> is the difference between the high and low tides. The highest tides are known as “spring tides” and they occur twice a lunar month (every 14 days) when the Moon, Sun and Earth are aligned to provide the strongest gravitational pull. The lowest tides are known as “neap tides”. These, again, occur twice in a lunar month when the Moon is at 90˚ to the Sun, causing the two bodies to cancel out each other’s gravitational forces. </p>

  <li>Population distribution describes the way that people are spread out across the Earth’s surface.</li>
  <li>Population density describes the number of people living in a given area. It is calculated as follows:</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>Population Density = Number Of People In an Area / Size of Area</p>

<ul>
  <li>Population distributions are often shown by means of a dot map, were each dot represents a given number of people. </li>
  <li>They provide a quick overview of the general characteristics of a distribution as well as indications of areas of high or low density e.g. Nile Valley in Egypt (where 99% of the country’s population live on 4% of the total land area).</li>
  <li>Population density can be displayed on a <em>dot map</em>. </li>

<h2 id="limitations-of-dot-maps">Limitations Of Dot Maps</h2>

<ul>
  <li>If many dots are concentrated in one part of the map then they will overlap making it difficult to identify one symbol from another making comparison of densities more difficult. </li>
  <li>They may suggest (incorrectly) that some areas are totally uninhabited e.g. Areas away from the Nile in Egypt when in fact there are insufficient numbers to warrant a symbol.</li>

<h2 id="distribution-of-africas-population">Distribution Of Africa’s Population</h2>

<p>Much of Africa’s population is distributed close to water sources. Close to coasts and lakes the population is very dense. Nigeria is particularly densely populated. The north and south of the African continent is far more sparsely populated with countries such as Niger having very few people per square kilometre. These areas are sparsely populated due to the lack of water sources making developing the area  and survival difficult. Areas such as Nigeria are closer to the sea, making it more densely populated due to the availability of a port for trade, and therefore work. Finally, areas such as Ghana are likely more densely populated due to the availability of water from lakes (e.g. Lake Volta).</p>

                <content type="html"><![CDATA[ <h2 id="a-rivers-course">A River’s Course</h2>

<p>The course a river takes is split into three stages, the upper, middle and lower stage. In the upper stage, the river is close to its source and high above its base level (the lowest point the river can erode to<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup>). In the lower stage the river is far away from its source, close to the mouth and not far above its base level. In the middle stage, it’s somewhere in between.</p>

<p>The total energy that a river possesses varies from one stage to another because of changes in the river’s height, gradient and speed. In the upper course, the gradient of the river is steep and the river is high above sea level giving it a large amount of gravitational potential energy that can be converted to kinetic energy later on. In the middle course, the river’s gravitational potential energy gets converted to kinetic energy and the gradient begins to level out resulting in the river’s velocity increasing. By the time the river reaches its lower stage, it has next to no gravitational potential energy but lots of kinetic energy resulting in a high velocity.</p>

<h2 id="the-long-profile">The Long Profile</h2>

<p>The long profile shows how a river’s gradient changes as it flows from its source to its mouth. You can draw a diagram of a river’s long profile either by drawing a quick sketch based on some previous knowledge or by plotting the height of the river above sea level at various points in its course. A sketch of a long profile would look something like this:</p>

<p><img src="/Images/rivers/long-profile-diagram.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The long profile shows how, in the upper stage of a river’s course, the river’s gradient is steep but it gradually flattens out as the river erodes towards its base level. One thing to note is the presence of knickpoints in the long profile. These are points where the gradient of the river changes suddenly and can be caused by landforms like waterfalls or lakes, where the lithology of the river changes and differential erosion takes place. Knickpoints can also be the result of <a href="/rivers/rejuvenation/">rejuvenation</a>, where the base level of the river falls giving it some extra gravitational potential energy to erode vertically.</p>

<p>Throughout the long profile of a river, deposition and erosion are balanced meaning that, given enough time, the river’s long profile would become a smooth, concave, <em>graded profile</em> and all the knickpoints would be eliminated as they are either eroded or filled in by deposition. It would take a <em>long</em> time for a river’s long profile to become a graded profile though so the idea of a graded profile is, essentially, theoretical as it doesn’t really occur in nature. It’s not too hard to imagine what a graded profile would look like but here’s a sketch of one anyway: </p>

<p><img src="/Images/rivers/graded-profile-diagram.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>If you needed to describe the graded profile you could describe it as a smooth, concave profile in dynamic equilibrium.</p>

<h2 id="changing-river-processes">Changing River Processes</h2>

<p>If there’s one key thing to take away from everything that’s been discussed so far it’s that the energy of a river changes as it flows through its course. As we’ve already discussed when we talked about <a href="/rivers/river-processes/">river processes</a>, rivers do stuff because they have energy and what they do depends on how much of a certain type of energy they have. Logically, this means that the processes that a river carries out changes throughout its course as it moves from one stage to another.</p>

<h3 id="processes-in-the-upper-course">Processes in the Upper Course</h3>

<p>In the upper course, the river has a lot of gravitational potential energy so it has a lot of energy to erode vertically. The bed of the river is eroded greatly while the banks aren’t eroded as much. The river mainly transports large pieces of angular rock and does so by traction because it doesn’t have enough kinetic energy to move the load in any other way. This increases erosion of the bed by corrasion as a result of the load being dragged along the bed of the river. Vertical erosion is further increased by the rough nature of the channel in the upper course which increases the water’s turbulence and its ability to erode. Erosion and transportation only takes place in large quantities in the upper course when the river’s discharge is high after periods of heavy precipitation. When the river’s discharge falls the river stops transporting the large boulders its transporting and deposits them. </p>

<h3 id="processes-in-the-middle-course">Processes in the Middle Course</h3>

<p>In the middle course, the river has less gravitational potential energy and more kinetic energy so erosion shifts from vertical to lateral erosion. Corrasion is still the main erosive process as large particles are transported by saltation. The average load size has decreased in the middle course, so more load is being transported in suspension. In the middle course, the river can flood and in doing so, it deposits gravel and sand sized particles onto its flood plain.</p>

<h3 id="processes-in-the-lower-course">Processes in the Lower Course</h3>

<p>In the lower course, the river has next to no gravitational potential energy so erosion is almost exclusively lateral. There isn’t much erosion though because the channel is smoother resulting in less turbulent flow. The main place where erosion takes place is where the river <a href="/rivers/river-landforms/#meanders">meanders</a>. The average particle size is very small now, another reason for the reduction in erosion. The river’s load is mainly composed of silts and clays and it is transported in suspension or even solution. Like in the middle course, when the river floods it deposits its load but deposition now also takes place at the mouth of the river where the river meets the sea or a stationary body of water. </p>

<h2 id="river-cross-profiles">River Cross Profiles</h2>

<p>River cross profiles show you a cross section of a river’s channel <strong>and</strong> valley at certain points in the river’s course. The cross profile of a river changes as it moves from the upper to lower course as a result of changes in the river’s energy and the processes that the river carries out. </p>

<p>In the upper course, the valley and channel are narrow and deep as a result of the large amount of vertical erosion and little lateral erosion. The sides of a river’s valley in the upper course are very steep earning these valleys the nickname <em>“V-Shaped Valley”</em> since they look like a letter V. The river’s valley can be anything from a few meters to a few hundred metres in width depending on the lithology but the channel rarely more than 5m or 6m wide. </p>

<p><img src="/Images/rivers/upper-course-cross-section.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>In the middle course, the valley has increased in width due to the increase in lateral erosion but its depth hasn’t changed significantly because vertical erosion has slowed down. Similarly, the channel’s width has increased but it’s still roughly the same depth. The land to either side of the channel in the valley is now the river’s floodplain and the valley’s sides are much more gentle. </p>

<p><img src="/Images/rivers/middle-course-cross-section.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>In the lower course the valley is now very wide (often several kilometres) and the floodplain has increased greatly in size. The channel is a little wider but not much deeper.</p>

<p><img src="/Images/rivers/lower-course-cross-section.png" alt="" /></p>

<h2 id="channel-efficiency--velocity">Channel Efficiency &amp; Velocity</h2>

<p>The speed that a river flows at is affected by the efficiency of a river’s channel. The efficiency of a river’s channel is, in turn, dependent on a few factors. The less friction between the water and the bed &amp; banks the higher the channel’s efficiency so to increase the channel’s efficiency you can do one of two things. Either a) Make the channel smoother to reduce friction or b) Reduce the amount of water that’s in contact with the bed and banks. </p>

<h3 id="hydraulic-radius">Hydraulic Radius</h3>

<p>The efficiency of a channel can be quantified as the channel’s <em>hydraulic radius</em>. The hydraulic radius shows you how efficient a channel is. The larger the hydraulic radius, the higher the channel’s efficiency. The hydraulic radius can be calculated using the following formula:</p>

<p>\[ R_h = \frac{A}{P} \]</p>

<p>Where \(R_h\) is the hydraulic radius, \(A\) is the cross sectional area of the channel and \(P\) is the wetted perimeter of the channel. The wetted perimeter is the length of the river’s bed and banks that is in contact with the water.</p>

<p>A large hydraulic radius is more efficient because it means that a smaller proportion of the river’s water is in contact with the bed &amp; banks so there is less friction. The ideal channel shape for a large hydraulic radius would be a narrow and deep channel. Wide and shallow channels are less efficient and have a smaller hydraulic radius.</p>

<p>Here’s an example of calculating the hydraulic radius. Consider the two channel cross sections below:</p>

<p><img src="/Images/rivers/channel-efficiency-example-diagram.svg" alt="" /></p>

<p>The cross sectional area of channel A is 20m<sup>2</sup> and its wetted perimeter is 14m so its hydraulic radius is 1.4. For channel B, the cross sectional area is 16m<sup>2</sup> and its wetted perimeter is 12m meaning that its hydraulic radius is 1.3. Channel A has the larger hydraulic radius so it’s the more efficient channel. We could have guessed that channel A is the more efficient channel without working out the hydraulic radius because it’s deeper and narrower than channel B. </p>

<h3 id="channel-roughness">Channel Roughness</h3>

<p>Leading on from the hydraulic radius of the channel is the roughness of the channel. If the channel is rough with lots of large, angular boulders sticking out, it’s going to impede the flow of the river and increase its wetted perimeter, reducing the river’s efficiency. This will, in turn, increase the hydraulic radius of the river. Rough channels will, however, increase the turbulence of a river, increasing the river’s ability to transport and erode material.</p>

<p>The roughness of a river’s channel (and hence its efficiency) changes between different stages in a river’s course. In the upper course, the channel is very rough so velocity and discharge are low except after heavy precipitation. In the lower course, the channel is much smoother so the river’s efficiency is greater and the velocity and discharge are much higher. </p>

<h2 id="channel-velocity">Channel Velocity</h2>

<p>The velocity of a river varies throughout the river’s course but the velocity of a river also varies within a specific cross section of the channel too. Close to the bed and banks friction is great so the river flows slower. In the centre of the channel, friction is lower so the river flows faster. The fastest point in a cross section of a channel is in the middle of the channel just beneath the surface so that friction with the bed, banks &amp; air is minimal. This point is known as the <em>thalweg</em>.</p>

<p>The velocity at different points in a channel’s cross section can be illustrated on a channel’s cross section using isovels: </p>

                <content type="html"><![CDATA[ <h2 id="what-is-coronary-heart-disease-chd">What is Coronary Heart Disease (CHD)?</h2>

<p>Coronary heart disease is the term that describes what happens when your heart’s bloody supply is blocked or interrupted by a build up of fatty substances in the coronary arteries.</p>

<h2 id="limitingpreventing-the-development-of-chd">Limiting/Preventing The Development of CHD</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Limit the energy intake from fats and shift fat consumption from saturated fats and unsaturated fats as well as limiting the intake of trans-fatty acids.</li>
  <li>Increase consumption of omega-3 from fish oil and plants. </li>
  <li>Consume a diet low in refined grains and high in vegetables, nuts and whole grain.</li>
  <li>Avoid excess healthy or sugary foods.</li>
  <li>Carry out at least 30 minutes of exercise per day. </li>
  <li>Avoid smoking.</li>
  <li>Maintain a healthy diet. </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="risk-factors-contributing-to-chd">Risk Factors Contributing to CHD</h2>

<p>People in MEDCs generally have low levels of physical activity due to the more “luxurious” lifestyles that they lead. People are generally employed in the tertiary sector, so little exercise is involved in their work and they spend long stretches of time sat at a desk. Furthermore, people often do not live close to their workplace, so they spend long commutes inside cars or on public transports when they could have been walking. Finally, the availability of TVs, games consoles and computers have significantly reduced physical activity, especially in children, leading to increased obesity levels, a major factor in the development of CHD. </p>

<p>This is not an issue in LEDCs as people do not have access to technology for entertainment and so find entertainment in other forms which often involve exercise. People in LEDCs also do not have easy access to vehicles, so they must walk greater distances, keeping people active and fit. </p>

<p>The lifestyle of people in MEDCs is also a significant factor in the development of CHD. As people have access to more disposable income, they are able to spend their money on luxuries such as tobacco and alcohol both of which have been shown to aid the development of CHD. In addition, more people in MEDCs are living to an old age and, as they get older, they become more likely to obtain “old age” diseases such as CHD. </p>

<p>The types of foods consumed in MEDCs is vastly different to the types consumed in LEDCs. Access to more money means people can access a wider range of foods, many of which are unhealthy (e.g chocolate, crisps/chips, chips/fries). These foods result in an increased calorie intake and, combined with a low level of activity, can lead to obesity and a significantly increased risk of contracting CHD. The more demanding or stressful lifestyle of people in MEDCs means that people don’t have time to cook their own food and will instead opt for the easier option of eating take-aways or ready made meals. These meals are often <em>very</em> unhealthy, containing significantly more salt and fat than most foods. </p>

<h2 id="effective-interventions-to-prevent-chd">Effective Interventions to Prevent CHD</h2>

<ul>
  <li>In <em>Mauritius</em>, cholesterol reduction was achieved by a government led effort to switch the main source of cooking oil from palm oil to soya bean oil which contains significantly less cholesterol. </li>
  <li><em>[South] Korea</em> has worked to retain its traditional, healthy, diet after an increasing amount of westernisation of the country’s cuisine. Government led initiatives and mass media campaigns to promote local cuisine and traditional cooking methods where effective in reducing the prevalence of CHD.</li>
  <li>In <em>Japan</em>, government led health campaigns have greatly reduced general salt consumption in the diet of the Japanese people. Coupled with increased blood pressure treatment, the blood pressure of the population has been reduced nation-wide. </li>
  <li>In the <em>U.S.A</em>, a decrease in saturated fat intake in the late 60s began the large decline of CHD cases seen in the last few decades. </li>
  <li>In <em>New Zealand</em>, the introduction of labelling logos for healthier foods forced many food companies to reformulate their products so that they would too be applicable for these labels. This led to a large decrease in the salt content of processed foods. </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="chd-in-the-uk">CHD In The UK</h2>

<ul>
  <li>CHD is the most common cause of death in the UK. It’s responsible for around 94,000 deaths per year. </li>
  <li>1 in 5 men &amp; 1 in 7 women die from CHD each year.</li>
  <li>Death rates in the UK have been falling since the 70s but are still among the highest in Europe. </li>
  <li>Within the UK, death rates are highest in Scotland and northern England. They are lowest in South England. There is a strong positive relationship between the number of deaths and the levels of deprivation in an area. </li>
</ul>

<p>The southwest of England has a moderately high number of deaths from CHD while the rest of southern England has much lower levels. The exception to this is the city of London, which has a very high number of deaths from CHD. Northern England has a much higher number of deaths from CHD, especially in the north west in cities such as Liverpool. Southern Wales, around Cardiff, have a similar death rate from CHD. </p>

                <content type="html"><![CDATA[ <p>Rivers have a lot of energy and because they have energy, they do stuff. The obvious things rivers do with their energy is flow but, besides this, they also transport load, erode load and erode the channel through which they flow. </p>

<h2 id="erosion">Erosion</h2>

<p>Erosion is the breaking down of material by an agent. In the case of a river, the agent is water. The water can erode the river’s channel and the river’s load. A river’s load is bits of eroded material, generally rocks, that the river transports until it deposits its load.</p>

<p>A river’s channel is eroded laterally and vertically making the channel wider and deeper. The intensity of lateral and vertical erosion is dictated by the stage in the river’s course, discussed in more detail <a href="/rivers/river-stages/">here</a> but essentially, in the upper stage of the river’s course (close to the source of the river) there is little horizontal erosion and lots of vertical erosion. In the middle and lower stages vertical erosion is reduced and more horizontal erosion takes place. </p>

<p>There are several different ways that a river erodes its bed and banks. The first is <em>hydraulic action</em>, where the force of the water removes rock particles from the bed and banks. This type of erosion is strongest at rapids and waterfalls where the water has a high velocity. The next type of erosion is <em>corrasion</em><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup>. This is where the river’s load acts almost like sandpaper, removing pieces of rock as the load rubs against the bed &amp; banks. This sort of erosion is strongest when the river is transporting large chunks of rock or after heavy rainfall when the river’s flow is turbulent. </p>

<p><em>Corrosion</em> is a special type of erosion that only affects certain types of rocks. Water, being ever so slightly acidic<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">2</a></sup>, will react with certain rocks and dissolve them. Corrosion is highly effective if the rock type of the channel is chalk or limestone (anything containing calcium carbonate) otherwise, it doesn’t have much of an effect.</p>

<p><em>Cavitation</em> is an interesting method of erosion. Air bubbles trapped in the water get compressed into small spaces like cracks in the river’s banks. These bubbles eventually implode creating a small shockwave that weakens the rocks. The shockwaves are very weak but over time the rock will be weakened to the point at which it falls apart.</p>

<p>The final type of erosion is <em>attrition</em>. Attrition is a way of eroding the river’s load, <strong>not</strong> the bed and banks. Attrition is where pieces of rock in the river’s load knock together, breaking chunks of rock off of one another and gradually rounding and shrinking the load.</p>

<h2 id="transportation">Transportation</h2>

<p>When a river erodes the eroded material becomes the river’s load and the river will then transport this load through its course until it deposits the load. There are a few different ways that a river will transport load depending on how much energy the river has and how big the load is. </p>

<p>The largest of particles such as boulders are transported by <em>traction</em>. These particles are rolled along the bed of the river, eroding the bed and the particles in the process, because the river doesn’t have enough energy to move these large particles in any other way. </p>

<p>Slightly smaller particles, such as pebbles and gravel, are transported by <em>saltation</em>. This is where the load bounces along the bed of the river because the river has enough energy to lift the particles off the bed but the particles are too heavy to travel by suspension.</p>

<p>Fine particles like clay and silt are transported in <em>suspension</em>, they are suspended in the water. Most of a river’s load is transported by suspension.</p>

<p><em>Solution</em> is a special method of transportation. This is where particles are dissolved into the water so only rocks that are soluble, such as limestone or chalk, can be transported in solution.</p>

<h3 id="capacity--competence">Capacity &amp; Competence</h3>

<p>Rivers can only carry so much load depending on their energy. The maximum volume of load that a river can carry at a specific point in its course is called the river’s <em>capacity</em>. The biggest sized particle that a river could carry at a specific point is called the river’s <em>competence</em>.</p>

<h2 id="deposition">Deposition</h2>

<p>To transport load a river needs to have energy so when a river loses energy it is forced to deposit its load. There’s several reasons why a river could lose energy. If the river’s discharge is reduced then the river will lose energy because it isn’t flowing as quickly anymore. This could happen because of a lack of precipitation or an increase in evaporation. Increased human use (abstraction) of a river could also reduce its discharge forcing it deposit its load. </p>

<p>If the gradient of the river’s course flattens out, the river will deposit its load because it will be travelling a lot slower. When a river meets the sea a river will deposit its load because the gradient is generally reduced at sea level and the sea will absorb a lot of energy. </p>

<h2 id="the-hjulstrm-curve">The Hjulström Curve</h2>

<p>A Hjulström curve is a special type of graph that shows how a river’s velocity affects it competence and its ability to erode particles of different sizes. There’s a lot going on on the graph but it’s fairly easy to read once you get the hang of it:</p>

<p><img src="/Images/rivers/hjulstrom-curve.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>There’s two curves on the Hjulström Curve, a <em>critical erosion velocity</em> curve and a <em>mean settling velocity</em> curve. The critical erosion curve shows the minimum velocity needed to transport <strong>and</strong> erode a particle. The mean settling velocity shows the minimum speed that particles of different sizes will be deposited by the river. The shaded areas between the curves show the different process that will be taking place for particles that lie in those shaded areas. </p>

<p>As an example, a river flowing at 10cms<sup>-1</sup> will transport clay, silt and sand particles but will deposit gravel, pebble and boulder particles. Conversely, a river flowing at 100cms<sup>-1</sup> will erode and transport large clay particles, silt particles, sand particles and most gravel particles. It will transport all but the largest of pebbles and will deposit boulders. </p>

<p>The easiest way to read the curve is to draw a horizontal line from the velocity you’re trying to read and seeing which shaded area it crosses the particle size you’re interested in in. This will tell you whether that particle is eroded, transported or deposited at that velocity.</p>

<p>There’s a few interesting things to note about the Hjusltröm Curve. The first is that clay sized particles don’t appear to have a mean settling velocity. This is because these particles are so fine that a river would have to be almost perfectly stationary in order for them to fall out of solution. In addition, the small particles seem to have an erosive velocity that’s the same as the velocity for larger particles. This is because smaller particles are cohesive, they stick together, making them harder to dislodge and erode without high velocities. </p>

                <content type="html"><![CDATA[ <h2 id="the-origin-of-hiv">The Origin of HIV</h2>

<p>The origin of HIV is a widely debated topic. The most common theory is that HIV originated in Africa around Uganda, Tanzania or Rwanda when a hunter ate a monkey that had been infected with a similar pathogen to the HIV virus. The HIV virus then mutated inside of the human, allowing it to become effective against humans too. Such a process is rare in nature, but not implausible, so this theory has gained some popularity.</p>

<p>An alternative (more “new world order”) theory is that the virus was created within a laboratory in the USA and was “leaked” into the surrounding environment and spread among humans. This theory is far less plausible, given that it doesn’t really explain how the disease managed to get to central Africa. </p>

<p>Yet another theory is the idea that the disease originated during drug trials in Africa, more specifically in Congo. While under Belgian rule, drug trials took place and several of the drugs were made from monkey parts. These drugs were then administered to the general population. This theory fits the pattern of the initial outbreak of the virus, but is considered biologically implausible. </p>

<h2 id="what-is-hiv--aids">What Is HIV &amp; AIDS?</h2>

<p>HIV and AIDS are not the same thing! AIDS is a disease that results from the HIV virus when left untreated. HIV (Human immunodeficiency virus), is a retrovirus carried within the human bloodstream that essentially destroys white blood cells (more specifically CD4 cells), responsible for protecting the body from many diseases. As the virus destroys these cells, the body’s white blood cell count drops, the body loses its immunity and is said to have AIDS (Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome). The person becomes susceptible to a variety of diseases which ultimately finish the person off. </p>

<p>AIDS wasn’t actually recognised as a medical condition until 1981 and its cause (HIV) wasn’t recognised until 1983. HIV/AIDS has spread rapidly since its initial discovery and is currently considered a global pandemic by the WHO. </p>

<p>AIDS is transferred between humans primarily when bodily fluids are exchanged (blood, during sex etc.). This can be due to using infected needles, either due to drug abuse or due to poor quality health care. Blood transfusions were, but no longer are, a source of HIV/AIDS (transfusions are now screened). HIV/AIDS can also be transferred during pregnancy. </p>

<p>The disease is currently considered incurable and a vaccine doesn’t exist (largely due to the rapidly changing nature of the virus). Antiretroviral treatments are available and can help prolong the life of individuals, but people’s life expectancy still falls substantially once infected with the disease. The actual effects of HIV/AIDS can take many years to appear after infection. </p>

<h2 id="management-of-hivaids">Management Of HIV/AIDS</h2>

<p>Given that a vaccine to the disease is many years away and potentially impossible, controlling the spread of the disease and caring for those that are ill is the only way to combat it and alleviate its effects. The use of antiretroviral drugs can help to alleviate some of the effects of the disease and increase the lifespan of an infected individual. These drugs are widely available but are very expensive and, despite costs falling over the past ten years, are not widely available in LEDCS, the countries which most need them. </p>

<p>Predicting the spread of the disease is important as it can allow us to allocate resources in specific areas which are at a high risk of infection. If predictions are combined with an aggressive prevention programme, the disease could potentially be wiped out without the need for a vaccine. </p>

<p>Education is, and will continue to be, the most powerful method for controlling and reducing the spread of the disease. The issue with education is how available it is. In many LEDCs, people can not afford education. In some countries, developed or not, it is difficult for certain groups of people to access education such as women, or homosexuals, who are particularly vulnerable to the disease. The provision of free tools such as condoms also help to reduce the spread of the disease. A somewhat controversial programme in the UK was to offer free, clean needles to drug users in order to help prevent the spread of the disease. </p>

<h2 id="the-spread-of-hivaids">The Spread of HIV/AIDS</h2>

<h3 id="section">1985</h3>

<p>Globally, HIV/AIDS is fairly rare. In central Africa, in countries such as Zimbabwe, Zambia and the Democratic Republic of Congo though, HIV/AIDS is very prevalent, with 5-15% of the population infected. HIV/AIDS is also present in the US and Brazil, but at a lower rate of 0.1-0.5%</p>

<h3 id="section-1">1995</h3>

<p>HIV/AIDS has spread globally and infection rates have increasing exponentially. Infection rates are now 0.5-1.1% (of the population) in America and in nearly all of South America’s countries. In South Africa, Botswana, Zimbabwe and Zambia, infection rates are incredibly high. 5-34% of the population is infected. The infection has spread to Europe too. Spain now has an infection rate of 0.5-1%.</p>

<h3 id="section-2">2005</h3>

<p>In America and South America, infection rates have remained the same in the past ten years. The whole of southern Africa has an infection rate of 15-34% and most of the rest of Africa has an infection rate of 5-15%. Infection rates have risen greatly in Russia to 5-15% of the population having HIV/AIDS. The disease has also become prevalent in Papua New Guinea, India and some Mediterranean countries. </p>

<h2 id="aids-in-uganda">AIDS in Uganda</h2>

<h3 id="background-information">Background Information</h3>

<p>Uganda, a country located in central Africa, is often though to be where the virus originated. Uganda has been heavily effected by AIDS and HIV. The first case in Uganda (and possibly the world) was diagnosed at Lake Victoria, in southern Uganda. After the civil war (1986), the infection rates of HIV/AIDS had soared with 29% of those in urban areas being infected with the disease. 1 Million people had the disease by 1990 in Uganda. This rose by 1.1 million over the next 11 years and in that time, 800,000 people had died.</p>

<p>In 1987, an AIDS control programme was launched. Since its launch, the prevalence rates have fallen and stabilised between 2001 to 2005 however they now appear to be rising again. </p>

<h3 id="prevention-programmes">Prevention Programmes</h3>

<ol>
  <li>The public has been educated significantly on the disease, prevention and its effects. Religious groups, political groups and non government organisations have been involved in raising awareness of the disease. The government promoted an ABC approach (Abstain, Be Faithful, Use Condoms) to educating the public. </li>
  <li>In 1990, a USAID funded programme helped exponentially increase the usage of condoms in Uganda from 7% to over 85% in urban areas. </li>
  <li>In 1997, a same day testing and counselling service was launched. Beforehand, people would have to wait two weeks for test results so many didn’t return to collect the results. </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="treatment-programmes">Treatment Programmes</h3>

<p>In 1998, a programme to distribute antiretroviral drugs was launched, helping to treat those infected and reduce the effects of the disease. The programme was problematic though, as patients had to pay for their treatment. A new programme was launched in 2004 to offer the antiretroviral drugs for free. The programme was funded by the world bank and  a Global Fund grant of $70 million. The program would appear to have been successful as by 2008, 50% of those who needed the drugs were receiving them. The infection rates of pregnant women in the capital, Kampala, have fallen dramatically from 31% to 14%. </p>

<p>Ultimately, Uganda wants to produce its own drugs, rather than importing them as this would cut the cost of the drugs down to $2-$9 per patient per month. </p>

<h3 id="lifestyle-impacts">Lifestyle Impacts</h3>

<p>AIDS has killed over a million people in Uganda and substantially lowered life expectancy. This has created a generation of orphaned children without parents, who themselves could be infected with the disease. In many families, the infection of just one family member can be devastating. It can require people to quit jobs in order to care for the individual but can also require them to obtain more work in order to pay for the treatment. Children have been known to abandon their education to work and care for their parents. A particularly worrying problem is the position of women. Women hold a low status in society in Uganda and many are forced to turn to prostitution to pay for antiretroviral drugs for their family, which can lead to an increased prevalence of the disease. </p>

<h3 id="impacts-on-economic-development">Impacts on Economic Development</h3>

<p>AIDS has drastically reduced Uganda’s agricultural output due to many of the workers being infected and killed by the disease. There has also been a drop in the number of people working in the education and health professions. </p>

<p>In order to fund the antiretroviral drug programme, the country has had to take out significant loans from the world bank and now faces a large debt and a potential GDP fall by 1.25%. </p>

<h3 id="impacts-on-health--health-care-systems">Impacts on Health &amp; Health Care Systems</h3>

<p>The massive increase in the number of ill patients and hospital admissions is putting substantial strain on hospitals and health care systems. Hospitals are running out of beds for patients, which is in turn reducing the likelihood of people not recovering, or at least surviving with the disease. Many health care workers have, themselves, been infected with the disease or must care for a family member who has been infected, making health care workers far more scarce. Finally, the administration of antiretroviral drugs requires special training, which costs money and time which is not available in Uganda.  </p>

                <content type="html"><![CDATA[ <h3 id="health">Health</h3>

<ul>
  <li>A high standard of health care in a country will help to lower infant mortality, reducing the birth rate as people don’t need to have as many children in order to ensure some survive.</li>
  <li>High health care standards ensure people have good access to modern health treatment, prolonging life expectancy and lowering death rate. </li>
  <li>In areas with balanced, healthy diets the death rate will be lowered but in countries with poor diets or a lack of food the death rate will increase due to malnutrition. </li>
  <li>Countries with high health care standards will have access to retroviral drugs giving them the potential to tackle HIV and other STIs.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="education">Education</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Emancipation of women will reduce the birth rate as women are able to get careers rather than staying at home and nurturing children also making them less likely to have children.</li>
  <li>Compulsory education ensures that people are educated about hygiene, STIs and contraception. Knowledge of basic hygiene will lower the death rate since people can maintain a better standard of hygiene (assuming the necessary items are available). Education about contraception will help reduce birth rate since people will be aware of the benefits of using contraception but again, this relies on the provision of contraceptives from governments or charities. </li>
  <li>Very high standards of education provide an opportunity for advanced education paving the way for the training of doctors and medical researchers potentially lowering the death rate thanks to new discoveries or the availability of better trained doctors.  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="social-provisions">Social Provisions</h3>

<ul>
  <li>If proper social care is provided to the elderly and they are well looked after, death rate will be reduced since they are able to live longer.</li>
  <li>If clean water is available, death rate is reduced as water born diseases such as cholera aren’t prevalent. In addition, people are able to wash themselves and clothing properly (rather than in a river, where they also obtain their drinking water) again reducing the death rate thanks to an improved hygiene standard. </li>
  <li>The availability of media makes it easier to educate people and raise awareness about outbreaks of diseases potentially reducing death rate. The availability of media is also important for educating people about hygiene, avoiding disease etc. if they were unable to attend school. </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="cultural-factors">Cultural Factors</h3>

<ul>
  <li>In some cultures and religions, people are respected more if they have many children resulting in an increased birth rate. For example, in some cultures having many children is seen as a sign of virility in men. </li>
  <li>Conversely, some cultures and religions discourage large families though this is rare. This would have the effect of lowering birth rate. </li>
  <li>Certain religions view birth control and abortion as bad in the eyes of their beliefs. As a result they discourage the use of these procedures resulting in an increased birth rate in countries where these religions are prevalent.</li>
  <li>In some non-secular countries, the use of contraception and, especially abortion, is outlawed resulting in a significantly higher birth rate and death rate as a result of the spread of STI’s. </li>
  <li>Some religions and cultures relegate the role of women preventing them from obtaining an education or career and encouraging/forcing them to have large families which results in an increased birth rate.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="political-factors">Political Factors</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Some countries provide benefits to people who have many children to encourage people to give birth (e.g. France) as a result of an aging population and a natural decrease. This has the desired effect of increasing birth rate.</li>
  <li>Alternatively some countries offer rewards to couples who have fewer children in order to encourage people to have less children resulting in a lowered birth rate.</li>
  <li>If taxes in a country are high, people may not have children as they can’t afford to, decreasing the birth rate. In addition, young people may migrate away from the country if they can afford to in order to escape the taxes reducing the countries (young, fertile) population and also resulting in an increased death rate due to the knock on effects of an aging population. </li>
  <li>During times of warfare the birth rate will fall significantly (since people are occupied fighting) and the death rate will often rise substantially. After a war however, there is often a “baby boom” resulting in a massive increase in the birth rate of a country. </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="environmental-factors">Environmental Factors</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Countries with frequent natural disasters will often have a high death rate. In addition, there may be a high number of people migrating away from the country for fear of their lives resulting in an overall reduction in the countries population. </li>
  <li>The climate may effect the death rates of a county. In warm countries, death rate may be increased due to the spread of disease, which spreads much easier in warm weather. In cold countries, death rate may also be high due to the effects of the cold and a lack of supplies (and easy access to them). This is especially true for the elderly in these countries.</li>
  <li>In countries with heavy industry, air and water pollution could be very high increasing the death rate as a result of polluted water supplies and air. In addition, it may increase infant mortality if clean water is unavailable resulting in a significantly higher birth rate as people have more children in order to ensure some survive. </li>

<ul>
  <li>Shingle beaches typically have a steep gradient (over 10˚) because the waves easily flow through the coarse, porous surface of the beach, decreasing the effect of backwash erosion and increasing the formation of sediment into a steep sloping back. </li>
  <li>Sandy beaches are typically flatter (&gt;5˚) and wider as the smaller particles are evenly distributed and water takes longer to percolate down into the sand so more sand is removed with the backwash. </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="beach-profile-features">Beach Profile Features</h2>

<h3 id="ridges--runnels">Ridges &amp; Runnels</h3>

<p>Parallel “hills and valleys” of sand found at the low water mark. These are formed due to the interaction of tides, currents and shallow beach topography and so are often formed as breakpoint bars. </p>

<h3 id="storm-beaches">Storm Beaches</h3>

<p>A ridge of boulders and shingle found at the back of the beach which have been thrown up to the back of the beach by the largest waves at high tides. </p>

<h3 id="cusps">Cusps</h3>

<p>Semicircular depressions formed by waves breaking directly on the beach with a strong swash and backwash. </p>

<h3 id="ripples">Ripples</h3>

<p>Develop on sandy beaches as a result of wave and tidal movements.</p>

<h2 id="beach-plans--longshore-drift">Beach Plans &amp; Longshore Drift</h2>

<p>A beach plan is formed as a product of the angle at which waves approach a beach. </p>

<ul>
  <li><em>Drift aligned</em> beaches are produced where waves break at an angle to the coast. The swash therefore occurs at an angle but the backwash runs perpendicular to the beach. As a result, material is transported along the beach via longshore drift.</li>
  <li>Some beaches show oblique alignments to the dominant wave fronts. This usually occurs where the beach gradient is steep and the wavelength is short. This is because the waves break at different points on the beach. </li>
  <li><em>Swash aligned</em> beaches (e.g. Hell’s Mouth) are produced where the waves break in line (parallel) with the coast. Swash &amp; backwash movements move material up and down the beach producing the aforementioned beach profile features. Swash aligned beaches are smoothy curved, concave beaches. The beach face is orientated parallel to the fronts of the dominant waves. Beaches which face the waves are termed swash aligned. </li>

The population has been growing exponentially in the past two centuries, going from just 0.75 billion in 1750 to 7 billion today. The population increase peaked in the 1960s, when the natural increase of the world’s population was 2.2%. Today, the natural increase has and is falling but it isn’t expected to level off until 2100. </p>

<p>The growth of the world’s population is not evenly distributed throughout the world. Depending on the economic development, the culture and <a href="/population/factors-effecting-world-population/">many other factors</a>, the population of different countries can vary quite significantly. Asia, for example, has experienced rapid population growth and the country of China now accounts for nearly 15% of the world’s population. Conversely, western countries such as the USA are experiencing a slow down in population growth and are expected to enter population decline fairly soon. </p>

<h3 id="population-doubling-time">Population Doubling Time</h3>

<p>Quite simply, the population doubling time is the time it takes for the population to double. </p>

<ul>
  <li>2% growth rate - population doubling time would be about 35 years.</li>
  <li>3% growth rate - population doubling time would be about 24 years. </li>

<ul>
  <li><em>Life Expectancy</em> - The average number of years a person from a specific country is expected to live. </li>
  <li><em>Birth Rate</em> - The number of (live) people born per 1000 of the population per year (normally per km<sup>2</sup>).</li>
  <li><em>Death Rate</em> - The number of people who die per 1000 of the population per year. </li>
  <li><em>Natural Change</em> - The change in the size of a population caused by the interrelationship between birth and death rates. If the birth rate exceeds the death rate then the population will increase. If the death rate exceeds the birth rate then the population will decrease.</li>
  <li><em>Annual Population Change</em> - The cumulative change to the size of a population after both natural change and migration have been accounted for.</li>

<h2 id="wave-motion">Wave Motion</h2>

<p>When the water a wave is travelling in becomes shallow, the normal circular motion a wave travels in begins to become elliptical due to the increased friction with the sea bed. This causes the wave to slow down and causes its height to increase. As the steepness of the wave increases, it becomes less stable and, when the steepness exceeds a 7:1 (height:length) ratio, the wave breaks. </p>

<h3 id="constructivesurging-waves">Constructive/Surging Waves</h3>

<p><img src="/Images/coasts/2waves/constructiveWaveDiagram.png" alt="Diagram of constructive wave." /></p>

<p>Constructive waves have a short amplitude and a long wavelength. They have a low frequency of around 6-8 waves per minute. Constructive waves produce a strong swash, but a weak backwash, which produces a gentle beach as material is deposited but not removed from the beach. The supply of new material and the constant action of pushing the material up the beach eventually produces berms. </p>

<h3 id="destructivesurfing-waves">Destructive/Surfing Waves</h3>

<p><img src="/Images/coasts/2waves/destructiveWaveDiagram.png" alt="Diagram of destructive wave." /></p>

<p>Destructive waves have a high amplitude and a short wavelength. They also have a high frequency of 10-14 waves per minute. The waves have a strong backwash but a weak swash, so they remove a lot of material from the beach producing a steeper beach profile. The force of destructive waves can fire material to the back of the beach where a ridge known as a storm beach forms.</p>

                <content type="html"><![CDATA[ <h2 id="global-patterns-of-death-rates">Global Patterns of Death Rates</h2>

<p>Globally, death rate varies quite significantly from country to country. In Europe, death rate is at a medium level, with 9-10 deaths per 1000 of the population. Eastern Europe &amp; Russia sees a small increase in death rate to 11-15 people per 1000 of the population. In Asia &amp; Arabic countries, the death rate falls in the vast majority of countries. China, for example, has a death rate of 5-6 people per 1000 of the population. Australia’s death rate is also quite low at 7-8 people per 1000 of the population. Overall, South America’s death rate is surprisingly low. Brazil’s death rate is 5-6 people per 1000 while other South American countries have a death rate of 7-8 people per 1000 of the population. </p>

<p>Europe’s medium level death rate is likely due to the ageing population. The death rate is worsened in eastern Europe and Russia due to the presence of AIDS/HIV, drugs and alcohol in the areas. </p>

<p>In MEDCs, including Europe and America, the primary source of death are diseases caused by unhealthy lifestyle choices. Type 2 diabetes, heart disease and lung cancer are all major causes of death. In addition to this, AIDS/HIV is still prevalent in some MEDCs with 40% of deaths in MEDCs caused by heart disease and AIDS/HIV. </p>

<p>In LEDCs, the majority of deaths are caused by curable infections such as TB, malaria and AIDS/HIV. In South Africa, HIV is especially rampant, with 60% of all the world’s cases of AIDS/HIV occurring in sub-saharan Africa. Unclean water supplies are also a large source of deaths by Cholera in Africa. These infectious diseases are far more common in LEDCs than MEDCs due to a lack of health care and available vaccines and medicines. In Afghanistan, for example, only $4 is spent per person on health versus $2,981 per person in the UK.</p>

<h2 id="global-patterns-of-infant-mortality-rates">Global Patterns of Infant Mortality Rates</h2>

<h3 id="why-is-imr-an-indicator-of-a-countrys-development">Why Is IMR An Indicator Of A Country’s Development?</h3>

<p>Infant mortality rate can be used to assess the health of the mother as, if she is unhealthy due to a lack of food or access to medicine, then neither her or her child will be healthy. This can also be an indicator of the education level of the mother as we can tell if she has been educated on how to care for her child. Finally, the IMR can be an indicator of health provisions such as access to medicine and midwives. </p>

<h3 id="global-imr-pattern">Global IMR Pattern</h3>

<p>In LEDCs, the IMR is significantly higher than in MEDCs. This is largely due to a lack of nutritious food and medicine, causing babies to die quickly via starvation or disease. The prevalence of aids in some countries can also be a factor leading to more infant deaths. In countries such as South Africa, the abundance of mosquitos and the lack of mosquito nets and anti-malaria vaccines can also be a major cause of deaths by malaria in infants. </p>

<h2 id="global-patterns-of-morbidity">Global Patterns of Morbidity</h2>

<p>Morbidity, the incidence of disease, is measured by the World Health Organisation (WHO) using DALYs (<strong>D</strong>isability <strong>A</strong>djusted <strong>L</strong>ife <strong>Y</strong>ears), the amount of life left due to disease or conditions. Globally, morbidity is higher in LEDCs than MEDCs. In MEDCs, the primary source of morbidity is from disease due to poor lifestyles and diseases from old age such as Alzheimer’s. The survival rate from these diseases is much higher in MEDCs too. The major sources of morbidity in LEDCs are perinatal conditions, AIDS, malaria and TB with much lower survival rates. There are some diseases that effect both types of countries such as depression and heart/lung diseases but these are caused for differing reasons. Depression in MEDCs can come from stressful situations and work whilst in LEDCs, depression is a common side effect of malaria. </p>

<h2 id="risk-factors">Risk Factors</h2>

<p>Morbidity is effected by certain risk factors. In LEDCs, these factors are malnutrition, social diseases (i.e. AIDS), unsanitary hygiene &amp; living conditions, a lack of clean water and poor living standards. In MEDCs, these factors are blood pressure, a lack of physical activity and lifestyle choices such as alcohol, tobacco and poor diets. </p>

<h2 id="global-patterns-of-life-expectancy">Global Patterns Of Life Expectancy</h2>

<p>In general, the life expectancy of individuals in MEDCs is higher than those in LEDCs. In addition most of the world’s women’s life expectancy is higher than men’s, with the average life expectancy of a woman being 66 years and a man’s being 62.7 years. This variation in life expectancy varies from country to country with a difference of 13 years between men and women in Russia, for example. Within countries, the better educated professionals generally have a longer life expectancy, while the poorer, working class generally have a lower life expectancy. </p>

<p>AIDS has played a major role in lowering the life expectancy of individuals in both LEDCs and MEDCs, though more so in LEDCs. In sub-saharan Africa, AIDS has lowered the life expectancy from 62 to 47 years. Nutrition, more specifically malnutrition, can lead to lowered life expectancies. A lack of nutritious food in both LEDCs and MEDCs can severely lower life expectancy. The quality and availability of health care is a significant factor in life expectancy too. In African countries and many other LEDCs, a very small percentage of the world’s health care workers are actually situated in the country. In Africa, 3% of the world’s health workers are present. The situation is far better in MEDCs, contributing towards MEDCs’ higher life expectancy. In the Americas, 42% of the world’s health workers are situated there. </p>

<p>The number of health workers in a country is directly tied to the quality and availability of education in a country. Poor education means fewer doctors, nurses and other medical staff can be trained, reducing life expectancy and increasing the reliance on other countries for health care. This situated is alleviated by the provision of aid, doctors and education to LEDCs through programs such as Doctors Without Borders.</p>

<p>The quality of life in a country can be a significant in people’s life expectancy as well. Poverty leads to malnutrition, a shortage of health care and depression. Depression itself, leads to many depression related diseases and, ultimately, suicide, significantly lowering a country’s life expectancy.  </p>

                <content type="html"><![CDATA[ <p>The discharge of a river (or stream) is the volume of water that flows past a point in the river’s course per second. The volume is measured in cubic metres (m<sup>3</sup>) and it’s per second so the units of discharge are cubic metres a second or m<sup>3</sup>s<sup>-1</sup>. Coincidentally, 1m<sup>3</sup>s<sup>-1</sup> is the same as 1 cumec so the discharge of a river is often measured in <em>cumecs</em> because it’s a bit easier to say. Discharge is normally measured at gauging stations that are situated at different points along the river.</p>

<p>The discharge of a river changes over time depending on a few factors. The most influential factor is the weather. After heavy rainfall the discharge of the river will be higher because there’s more water entering the river. The weather affects discharge so much that there’s a special graph that we can draw called a <em>hydrograph</em> which shows precipitation and discharge on the same graph and makes it easy to see how quickly precipitation affects the discharge of a river. A <em>storm hydrograph</em> is a specific type of hydrograph that, surprise, surprise, shows precipitation and discharge during and after a storm. The main difference between a normal hydrograph and a storm hydrograph is that a storm hydrograph is over a much shorter period of time. Below is a storm hydrograph for the fictional River Shui:</p>

<p><img src="/Images/rivers/storm-hydrograph.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>There’s a curve showing the discharge of the river and there’s a series of bars showing some (fairly heavy) precipitation. There’s a few things to note on this graph. First is the <em>lag time</em>. The lag time is the time difference between the peak precipitation and and the peak discharge. A long lag time indicates that it’s taking a long time for precipitation to enter the river. Conversely, a short lag time indicates that the precipitation is entering the river fairly quickly. The <em>rising limb</em> is the steep part of the discharge line that has a positive gradient, indicating that the discharge is increasing. The <em>falling limb</em> is the opposite showing that the discharge is falling.</p>

<h2 id="factors-affecting-a-storm-hydrograph">Factors Affecting a Storm Hydrograph</h2>

<h3 id="the-drainage-basin">The Drainage Basin</h3>

<p>The shape of a hydrograph is altered by a few different things. One factor is the shape of the drainage basin. Drainage basins come in a wide assortment of shapes. (Roughly) Circular shapes are common as are more elongated and narrow shapes. For a circular drainage basin, the river’s hydrograph can often be described as “flashy” because it will have a fairly steep rising limb and a high peak discharge. This is because all points in the drainage basin are (again, roughly) equidistant from the river so all the precipitation reaches the river at the same time.</p>

<p>The size of the drainage basin obviously has an impact on the hydrograph. Large basins will have high peak discharges because they catch more precipitation but at the same time they’ll have longer lag times than small basins because the water takes longer to reach the rivers.</p>

<p>Basins with steep slopes will have a high peak discharge and a short lag time because the water can travel faster downhill. Finally the drainage density of a basin will affect the lag time and the steepness of the falling limb. Basins with lots of streams and rivers (a high drainage density) will have a short lag time and a fairly steep falling limb because water will drain out of them quickly.</p>

<h3 id="soil--rock-type">Soil &amp; Rock Type</h3>

<p>If a river is surrounded by impermeable rocks, it’s going to have a high peak discharge and a short lag time because the rocks won’t let water percolate forcing it to travel via overland flow which is faster than groundflow, interflow and throughflow. In addition, the rocks won’t be able to store any water if they’re impermeable so the peak discharge is increased as more water will be entering the river rather than being stored in the drainage basin. </p>

<p>The ability for the soil to let water infiltrate has a similar effect to the type of rocks in a basin. Fine soil that allows water to infiltrate will reduce a river’s peak discharge and increase the lag time because the water is either stored in the soil or travels slowly as throughflow. Clay soils don’t allow water to infiltrate easily so most of it travels quickly as overland flow which will reduce the lag time.</p>

<h3 id="weather--climate">Weather &amp; Climate</h3>

<p>The intensity of a storm will obviously impact the peak discharge of the river. More rainwater = more water in the river so a higher discharge. Not immediately obvious is the type of storm (or precipitation) that takes place. A winter storm (i.e. snow) will result in an increase in the river’s discharge when the snow melts but this often won’t be for a long time, so the lag time will be huge.</p>

<p>If it’s been raining heavily previously, the ground may be waterlogged so the lag time will be reduced because water will be unable to infiltrate and will instead travel via overland flow. Similarly, if the climate’s been hot &amp; dry or freezing cold the ground will be hard and water will once again be unable to infiltrate and will instead travel as overland flow, reducing the lag time and increasing the peak discharge.</p>

<h3 id="vegetation-cover">Vegetation Cover</h3>

<p>If the area surrounding the river has thick vegetation cover then lots of precipitation will be intercepted, greatly increasing the lag time. In addition, the peak discharge will decrease because vegetation will absorb the water and lose it through transpiration and evaporation.</p>

<h3 id="human-activity">Human Activity</h3>

<p>Humans will normally cover soil in impermeable materials like tarmac or concrete which will increase surface run off and reduce the amount of water being stored, increasing the peak discharge and reducing the lag time. As water doesn’t infiltrate easily in urban areas humans often build storm drains that run directly into a river, reducing the lag time and increasing the river’s peak discharge.</p>

<h2 id="analysing-storm-hydrographs">Analysing Storm Hydrographs</h2>

<p>It’s very common for questions about hydrographs to come up in the exam but that’s OK, these are normally 2 or 4 mark questions that ask you to read something off a graph or describe the graph. Easy marks. The ever so slightly harder questions are the ones that ask you to explain a hydrograph because these require you to think. Let’s look at the storm hydrograph for the fictional River Shui again:</p>

<p><img src="/Images/rivers/storm-hydrograph.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>If asked to describe the hydrograph you could quote the lag time, peak discharge and comment on the steepness of the rising and falling limbs (remember, state values off of the graph). Instead, you could be asked to explain the hydrograph’s shape. These reasons are essentially all the factors we discussed previously. You need to state a factor and then explain how and why it affects the shape of the hydrograph.</p>

<p>For the River Shui’s hydrograph, we could say that the high peak discharge and the steep rising limb suggests that the drainage basin is circular because if it was, the precipitation will land at points equidistant from one another and reach the river at roughly the same time, producing the high peak discharge.</p>

<h3 id="terrestrial">Terrestrial</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Rock type of the coast. If the coast is made from soft rock, it will be eroded far more quickly than if it is made of hard rock. </li>
  <li>Deltas form where rivers meet the sea, which will alter the shape of coasts. </li>
  <li>Composition of rock layers on coasts will affect their shapes.</li>
  <li>Tectonics in the area will effect coasts. Earthquakes can move rock and trigger tsunamis, which can destroy entire coastlines.</li>
  <li>Mangroves and coral reefs can alter the shape of coasts as they slow down incoming waves, decreasing the rate at which a coast is eroded. </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="human">Human</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Ports, docks and transport can be constructed and/or used on coasts, thus altering the shape of coasts. Boats can destroy coral reefs and hence increase the erosion of the coastline. </li>
  <li>Coasts can be used for recreation and tourism. The increased foot traffic and demand for certain attractions on coastlines can alter their shape substantially. </li>
  <li>Humans can settle on coastlines. Often, settlements on coastlines will thrive due to their proximity to the sea for trade and tourism. </li>
  <li>Global warming is altering the shape of coastlines due to the rising sea levels resulting from it. </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="atmospheric">Atmospheric</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Certain types of weather can effect coasts. High winds and heavy rain will erode coasts. </li>
  <li>The Moon (and the Sun and Jupiter to some extent) effects the tides substantially, which can alter the shape of coasts.</li>
  <li>Temperatures alter the shape of coasts. </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="marine">Marine</h3>

                <content type="html"><![CDATA[ <p>Rivers are dynamic, open systems. They take water from the global hydrological cycle, use it in their own local hydrological cycle and then return the water to the global cycle. The global hydrological cycle is a closed system. It (as far as you’re aware) doesn’t have any inputs or outputs, it remains constant<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p>When considering the hydrological cycle of a river, normally you look at the hydrological cycle of a river’s <em>drainage basin</em>. The drainage basin of a river is the area surrounding a river where precipitation flows into the river. It is sometimes called the catchment area because it is where the river “catches” its water. The boundary between two drainage basins is the <em>watershed</em>. Any precipitation that lands beyond the watershed lands in a different drainage basin and is part of a different river’s hydrological cycles.</p>

<h2 id="inputs--outputs">Inputs &amp; Outputs</h2>

<p>A drainage basin is an open system meaning it has inputs and outputs. The most obvious input (at least here in Britain) is rain but snow, hail &amp; dew all act as inputs too. These inputs (including rain) are grouped under the term <em>precipitation</em>, water that falls or condenses on the ground. Basins also have outputs that are, again, pretty obvious. Evaporation is a big one, where water turns into a gas and become part of the atmosphere. Transpiration is similar to evaporation but is the loss of water as a vapour from plant and tree leaves. The combined effect of evaporation and transpiration is called <em>evapotranspiration</em>.  The final output, the one that a lot of people forget, is water flowing out of the basin. The technical name for this is <em>river discharge</em>.</p>

<h2 id="stores">Stores</h2>

<p>A store is a way of storing water in a drainage basin. There’s a couple of different types of water storage. One is <em>vegetation storage</em>. Vegetation lives off of water right? Well, any vegetation in a drainage basin will take up precipitation and store it, simple. The vegetation storage is the total volume of water stored in the vegetation in a basin at one time.</p>

<p>Vegetation provides another type of storage too, <em>intercepted storage</em>. Vegetation doesn’t store all of the water it comes into contact with, some of it is intercepted by leaves where the water will remain until it evaporates or falls to the ground. Although vegetation is the most common interceptor of water, buildings and other structures will intercept water and act as stores too.</p>

<p>A lake or a pond is another type of storage as is their smaller cousin, a puddle. Yes puddles are small but they all add up to form <em>surface storage</em>. This can be  a significant percentage of the total amount of water stored in a drainage basin. In addition to being stored on the surface, water is stored in the ground too. This is known as <em>groundwater storage</em>. This could be water that has been absorbed by the soil or it could be water that has percolated into rocks. You may have heard of a little something called the water table. The water table is a form of groundwater storage made up of lots of aquifers (permeable rocks) that have had their pores filled with water.</p>

<p>The final sort of storage is so obvious it isn’t obvious. Remember, we’re talking about stores in a drainage basin here, not the river itself, so any river channels that flow through the basin act as one giant store!</p>

<h2 id="flows">Flows</h2>

<p>Flows are fairly simple, they’re just the different ways that water can move from point A to B in a drainage basin. One of the obvious types of flow is <em>channel flow</em>. The name gives it away, this is where water flows through a river channel at a speed dependent on the <a href="/rivers/long-and-cross-profiles/#channel-efficiency--velocity">channel’s efficiency</a>.</p>

<p>Another type of flow is <em>overland flow</em>. You may have heard of this as <em>surface runoff</em>. This is where water travels across the surface of the ground when it can’t infiltrate into it. You’ll get this sort of flow when the ground is baked (dried for extensive periods of time), saturated or frozen. You can also get overland flow when you have a lot of impermeable rocks that water can’t permeate through. Overland flow is fastest when the water is travelling down a steep sided hill and almost non-existent when the land is flat.</p>

<p>I used a term called <em>infiltration</em> in the previous paragraph. This is where water seeps into the soil through cracks and breaks in the surface. Once the water is in the soil, it can travel around in one of several different ways. One way is through <em>throughflow</em> where water moves downhill through the soil under the influence of gravity. The speed of throughflow is dependent on the type of soil and the presence of things like cracks and burrows which act as tunnels through which the water can flow. Instead of travelling through throughflow, the water can continue to seep into the soil and <em>percolate</em> down to the water table. At this point, it can travel above the water table through permeable rocks as <em>interflow</em>. Alternatively, it can travel beneath the water table as <em>groundwater flow</em>. If this groundwater feeds into a river, it’s called <em>baseflow</em>. The speed of interflow and groundwater flow is highly dependent on the permeability of the rocks the water’s travelling through. These processes are normally very slow but permeable rocks will make them faster<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">2</a></sup>. Vesicular<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote">3</a></sup> rocks, such as pumice or vesicular basalt, allow water to percolate far more easily than rocks like granite, which aren’t vesicular.</p>

<p>There’s two more type of flow that we haven’t discussed, the first is <em>stemflow</em>. Like channel flow, the name’s a bit of a giveaway with this one. Stemflow is water that runs down the stems of plants or, alternatively, the trunks of trees. The second type of flow is <em>throughfall</em> (not to be confused with throughflow). This is where water drips off of leaves that have intercepted precipitation.</p>

<h2 id="the-water-budget-equations">The Water Budget Equation(s)</h2>

<p>Eep! Equations. Don’t worry, these equations (well, formulae if you want to get picky) are easy (they’re just addition), although there is a bit of Greek in them.  The water budget equation(s) relate precipitation \(P\), evapotranspiration \(E\), run off \(Q\) &amp; soil water storage \(S\). If you have a value for three of those variables, you can find the other one using simple addition. To find precipitation, for example:</p>

<p>\[ P = E + Q + \Delta S \]</p>

<noscript><strong>Does that equation look garbled to you? You need to enable JavaScript to see these equations properly.</strong></noscript>

<p>That triangle is the Greek letter “delta”, it means change in, so that equation reads as “precipitation = evapotranspiration + run off + change in soil water storage”. You’ve already met precipitation, evapotranspiration and soil water storage but what’s run off? Run off is the volume of water passing the watershed; that is, flowing out of the drainage basin and into another one.</p>

<p>Typically, we use the water budget equations to calculate the amount of water stored in the soil rather than the precipitation in the drainage basin because it’s a lot easier to measure all the other variables than it is to measure the volume of water stored in the soil. From this point on, when I talk about the water budget, I’m referring to the amount of water stored in the soil with respect to precipitation, evapotranspiration &amp; run off.</p>

<p>In the UK, or any place with a relatively temperate climate, the water budget changes in a predictable pattern throughout the year as the seasons (and hence the weather) change. In the winter months, there’s a large volume of precipitation but little evapotranspiration. This is primarily due to the colder, wetter climate and shorter daylight hours. When there’s more precipitation than there is evapotranspiration it’s called a <em>ground water surplus</em>. As the summer months approach, the climate becomes warmer &amp; drier and the daylight hours increase<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote">4</a></sup>.  This results in less precipitation and more evapotranspiration and we get <em>ground water utilisation</em>. All the water that was being stored in the soil in the wetter months is starting to be used up. By the middle of the summer, so much evapotranspiration has taken place and so little precipitation has fallen there isn’t much water left stored in the soil, this results in a <em>ground water deficit</em>.  As the end of the summer approaches and the colder, wetter weather starts to appear again, precipitation once again begins to outnumber evapotranspiration and a <em>ground water recharge</em> takes place until we get a ground water surplus again. The cycle just keeps repeating itself over and over again.</p>

<p>You can graph the water budget if you want. If you plot evapotranspiration and precipitation on one axis and the month on another, you’ll get two curves. Here’s an example for a (fictional) drainage basin in the UK or some other temperate climate:</p>

      <p>Technically this is not true. The Earth gets water from space when comets impact the Earth and loses water to space too. Water in the upper atmosphere is slowly lost to space as it “evaporates” away. Huge meteorite impacts will throw lots of debris into space which contains a fair bit of water as well.  <a href="#fnref:1" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>

      <p>A vesicular rock is one with a vesicular texture (yay, recursive definitions!); that is, it’s an igneous rock made up of lots of vesicles. Vesicles are cavities within the rock that formed when the lava that made the rock quickly cooled with gas bubbles trapped in it. As water percolates through the rocks, it can change their texture so that they become amygdaloidal. This is where minerals in the water precipitate (this is different to precipitation) out of the water flowing through the vesicles, over time filling them in. This can create some pretty nice looking rocks like amygdaloidal basalt. <a href="#fnref:3" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>

<h2 id="how-can-we-assess-health">How Can We Assess Health?</h2>

<p>We can look at:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Mortality</li>
  <li>Crude Death Rate</li>
  <li>Infant Mortality Rate</li>
  <li>Morbidity<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup></li>
  <li>Attack Rates <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">2</a></sup></li>
  <li>Case mortality rates <sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote">3</a></sup></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="factors-effecting-mortality--morbidity">Factors Effecting Mortality &amp; Morbidity</h2>

<ul>
  <li><em>Health care provisions</em>, such as the number of people per doctor. When there’s fewer people per doctor health care can be far better. In addition, the availability of health care can effect mortality/morbidity rates. The USA requires people to pay for their healthcare whereas the UK offers it for free, which allows more people to access health care. </li>
  <li><em>Economic development</em>: MEDCs have access to better medical technologies such as MRI scanners making diagnosing and curing diseases far easier and more likely. In addition, if the country has more money, they can spend more money on health care provisions. </li>
  <li><em>Education</em>: People can be educated about healthy eating &amp; lifestyles. They can also gain knowledge of basic hygiene, contraception and caring of children. A good education system also provides people with the opportunity to become doctors &amp; nurses. </li>
  <li><em>Age</em>: The young and old are highly susceptible to disease and the older someone is, the more likely they are to die. In areas with a high percentage of elderly people, there will be a higher death rate. </li>
  <li><em>Food &amp; water supply</em>: Access to clean water and nutritious food help prevent the spread of disease and malnutrition. Malnutrition is also an issue in MEDCs due to a shortage of people eating nutritious, healthy food either out of choice or due to the higher cost of healthy food.</li>
  <li><em>Climate</em>: Climate can help spread disease in warm areas or can act as a vector for diseases by providing a climate suitable for creatures that spread disease. The very hot or very cold climates can also trigger asthma and heart attacks.</li>
  <li><em>War &amp; Conflict</em>: Obviously increases death rate but war can also impact food supplies and increase morbidity due to malnutrition. </li>
  <li><em>Affluence</em>: More affluent individuals have access to more nutritious food and better health care simply because they have more money. </li>
  <li><em>Culture</em>: Attitudes towards women and the elderly can effect health care. In Afghanistan, for example, women can not be seen by male doctors and could not be educated to become nurses, totally eliminating any health care available for them. Traditional foods eaten in many mediterranean countries can help to increase life expectancy. </li>
  <li><em>Lifestyle</em>: Whether/how much people drink, smoke, exercise or eat healthy foods can effect mortality and morbidity. </li>
</ul>
