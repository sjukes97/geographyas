In order to get a decent mark in Geography you *need* to use case studies and examples in your answers. Many of the marks in the longer questions are dependent on the inclusion of examples. If you don't include them, you can't get high marks. Even if a question doesn't ask for an example, throw one in your answer, just to be safe. For many features, you don't need to name a specific example, just an area where you can find these features. For example, naming a specific pothole would be a bit silly, but naming an area where you can find them is quite sensible. 

## Rivers

### Case Studies

- Flooding in a MEDC. [(Boscastle 2004)][boscastle-floods]

- Hard engineering project. [(The Three Gorges Dam, China)][three-gorges-dam]
- Soft engineering project. [(Restoring the River Cole)][restoring-river-cole]

### Examples

- Potholes: The Strid on the River Wharfe (Yorkshire, UK).
- Waterfall: Pecca Falls (Ingelton, Yorkshire).

## Population

### Case Studies

- Pro Natalist Country [(France)][france-pro-natalism]
- Anti Natalist Country [(China)][china-anti-natalism]
- Immigration Control [(US-Mexico)][us-mexico-immigration]
- Transmigration [(Indonesia)][indonesia-transmigration]

### Examples

There are _tonnes_ of examples for the population topic. Far too many to list. Just try and remember every little fact and figure you see. Populations, birth rates, population densities, locations, GDPs, as much as you can. 

## Health Issues

### Case Studies

- An infectious disease [(AIDS in Uganda)][aids-uganda]
- A non-infectious disease [(Coronary Heart Disease)][chd]
- Famine [(Ethiopian Famine)][ethiopian-famine]
- A comparison of different healthcare schemes [(France vs USA vs UK Healthcare)][france-uk-us-healthcare]
- Tobacco Transnational Corporation [(British American Tobacco)][bat-tnc]
- Pharmaceutical Transnational Corporation [(Glaxosmithkline)][gsk-ptnc]
- Local variations in healthcare [(Wirral)][wirral-healthcare]

### Examples

Much like the population topic, there are loads of examples for the health issues topic. Again, just try and remember as many little facts and figures as you can. 

## “Fudging” Examples

While it's pretty important you learn the case studies and examples to get a good mark, how well you learn the figures is pretty unimportant. You can generally fudge figures in the exam. For example, if discussing transmigration in Indonesia, you _could_ say that it cost the government $7,000 per family to fund it but, if you can't remember the exact figure, just make up a sensible number. The examiner probably won't check the figure since different sources will have different figures. Just don't go saying it cost $10 per family or something ridiculous like that. 

Likewise, if you can't remember an example of a landform, invent one. Did you know there's a River Shuǐ in China with lots of rapids? There isn't really[^3] but the examiner doesn’t know that and he/she is unlikely to check that it exists. If they do, you won’t lose any marks, you just won’t gain any either. If you can’t remember an example, it’s worth a shot just making one up.

[^1]: The River Isis is actually the Thames. 

[^2]: Trust me, very few of these are easy to spell. Magdalenafjord, [Tysfjord](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tysfjord), [Hardangerfjord](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardangerfjord), [Eyjafjörður](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eyjafj%C3%B6r%C3%B0ur).

[^3]: There actually might be since shuǐ (水) means water in Chinese.
