<h2 id="chinas-one-child-policy">China’s One Child Policy</h2>

<h3 id="history">History</h3>

<ul>
  <li><em>1953</em> - First modern census takes place in China. The population comes in as 583 million. </li>
  <li>Between 1953 and 1964 the population increased by 112 million as Mao Zedong encouraged larger families in an attempt to make China stronger. </li>
  <li>Attempts to slow down population growth were started in the 1970s using the slogan “Later, longer, fewer”. People were encouraged to limit families to two children.</li>
  <li><em>1979</em> - One child policy introduced. </li>
  <li><em>2010</em> - Population: 1.335 billion.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="reasons-for-the-policy">Reasons for the policy</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Combat population explosion.
    <ul>
      <li>Imbalances between population and available resources. China has 7% of the world’s agricultural land and 23% of the world’s population. </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>To encourage economic development
    <ul>
      <li>Improving the standard of living for the population.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="mechanisms">Mechanisms</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Law introduced to limit the number of births applied to the Han majority (90% of the population) but not the ethnic minorities. </li>
  <li>Cash bonuses, improved housing and free education/medical care if couples limit themselves to one child. </li>
  <li>Free birth control and family planning advice. </li>
  <li>Age limits and certificates for marriage. Couples would have to apply for marriage certificates. </li>
  <li>Anyone housing more than one child lost benefits and faced financial penalties (generally 3× their salary). </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="issues">Issues</h3>

<h4 id="demographic-structure">Demographic Structure</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Future ageing population and high dependency ratios. </li>
  <li>Shortage of economically active age group. </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="gender-structure">Gender Structure</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Ratio of 117 males for every 100 females among babies from birth through children of four years of age. Normally, 105 males are born for every 100 females. </li>
  <li>By 2020, an estimated 30 million men will be unable to find a wife and have a child earning them the title “Bare branches”.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="civil-liberties--human-rights">Civil Liberties &amp; Human Rights</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Women pregnant for a second time often coerced into having an abortion or sterilisation particularly during the early years of the policy. </li>
  <li>“Granny Police” were recruited in settlements to spy on people in their community who might be trying to keep a pregnancy secret. </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="civil-unrest">Civil Unrest</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Opposition in rural areas, where stronger requirements for sons to work in fields, continue family name and look after parents in their old age, exist.</li>
  <li>Reports of gender selective abortions, hidden children, abandoned girls and, in rare cases, female infanticide. </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="little-emperor-syndrome">Little Emperor Syndrome</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Indulged and closeted boys who are often arrogant and lacking in social skills.  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="future">Future</h3>

<h4 id="amendments">Amendments</h4>

<ul>
  <li>In rural areas, if the first child is a girl then a couple can have a second child. </li>
  <li>If the first child is unhealthy, a couple can have a second child. </li>
  <li>If both parents are only children, they can have two children. </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="success">Success</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Total fertility rate has declined from 6.2 in 1950 to 1.6 in 2009, which is below replacement level. The rate of natural increase has declined to 0.5% from 2.2% in the 1970s. </li>
  <li>Policy has met the most success amongst urban populations. It has been less successful in rural areas where families have continued to have 2 or 3 children. </li>
  <li>It is estimate that without the policy there would have been an extra 400 million Chinese people born between 1970 and 2009. </li>
  <li>The reduction in the rate of population growth during the 1990s was accompanied by a noticeable rise in GNP. </li>
  <li>Greater equality for women as status is enhanced. Women are offered more opportunities for gaining greater knowledge. </li>
</ul>
