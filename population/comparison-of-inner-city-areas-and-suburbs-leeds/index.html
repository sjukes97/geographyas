<h2 id="population-distribution-of-leeds">Population Distribution of Leeds</h2>

<p>The densest areas are found in central Leeds in wards such as Harehills and Headingley. Here the population density exceeds 44 people per hector. To the south west and west of central Leeds, the population is still reasonably dense but not as dense as in the centre, with a density of around 11 - 44 people per hector. To the north, north east &amp; the east of Leeds, the population is far less dense, with 0 - 11 people per hector. The larger wards, such as Barwick &amp; Kippax, aren’t particularly dense. </p>

<p>According to census data, significantly more people live in the outer suburbs than in the inner city. Around 6,000 more people live in the suburbs. Despite this, the density in the outer suburbs is only 3.44 people per hector whereas the density in the inner city is around 20.93 people per hector. Significantly more people own their homes in the suburbs while only 28% rent property. Nearly half of the people living in the suburbs live in detached homes, while half of the population in the inner city live in terraced homes. The average weekly income in the suburbs is nearly double that in the inner city with the income being £680 and £370 respectively. Employment rates are similar in both the inner city and suburbs, with unemployment being about 5% lower in the suburbs. Generally, people in the suburbs regard their health to be better than those in the inner city. 73% of people in the suburbs were happy with their help versus 63% in the inner city. Finally, ethnic groups vary greatly between the inner city and the suburbs. In the suburbs, 98% of the population is white. In the inner city, this falls to 85%, with 12% being Asian, 2% black and 1.5% mixed.</p>
