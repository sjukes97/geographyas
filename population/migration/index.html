	<h1><b>Migration</b></h1>
</div>
<p>The United Nations describes migration as the movement of a person or persons from one place to another, involving a permanent (one year or more) change of address. Migration can be within a country or to another. </p>

<h2 id="why-do-people-migrate">Why Do People Migrate?</h2>

<ul>
  <li>For economical, environmental, sociocultural or political reasons. </li>
  <li>Migration can be voluntary or forced, temporary or permanent, national or international. </li>
  <li>Population movements are driven and sustained by potential push and pull forces due to an imbalance in economic activities and opportunities. </li>
  <li>Push factors are features of the home area which creates pressure and so causes people to move away. e.g. persecution, unemployment &amp; poverty.</li>
  <li>Pull factors operate at places outside of the migrant’s home area to attract individuals to a new location. e.g. political asylum, a promotion, high living standards in another area.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="consequences-of-migration-on-the-country-of-origin">Consequences Of Migration On The Country Of Origin</h2>

<h3 id="economic-impacts">Economic Impacts</h3>

<h4 id="positive">Positive</h4>

<ul>
  <li>The area benefits from remittences sent home. </li>
  <li>Upon return, migrants bring new skills to the country such as the ability to speak foreign languages.These new skills can help to improve the economy in the country of origin. </li>
  <li>There is less pressure on resources such as food and social services such as health care. </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="negative">Negative</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Loss of young workforce; those with skills and those with entrepreneurial talents move, slowing economic development. </li>
  <li>Loss of labour may reduce inward investment by private companies, increasing dependencies on government initiatives. </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="social-impacts">Social Impacts</h3>

<h4 id="positives">Positives</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Population density is reduced and birth rate falls as it’s the younger population who migrates. This can help ease overpopulation. </li>
  <li>Remittances sent home by economic migrants can be used to finance improved education &amp; health service. </li>
  <li>Returning migrants increase social expectations for communities, for example, increasing demand for better leisure facilities. </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="negatives">Negatives</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Marriage rates fall and family structures break down as men migrate producing a generation of single mums. </li>
  <li>Lots of young people migrating out of the country can increase the dependency ratio. </li>
  <li>Returning retired migrants may increase social costs on the community as support mechanisms aren’t in place for them. </li>
  <li>Migration of men and young families can cause a loss of cultural leadership and traditions. </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="political-impacts">Political Impacts</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Policies to encourage natural increase can be developed. </li>
  <li>Policies to encourage immigration to counteract outflow. </li>
  <li>Requests for international aid. </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="consequences-of-migration-on-the-host-country">Consequences Of Migration On The Host Country</h2>

<h3 id="economic-impacts-1">Economic Impacts</h3>

<h4 id="positive-1">Positive</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Migrants take up less desirable, menial jobs which natives would not take but need filling. </li>
  <li>The host country can gain skilled labour for cheap. </li>
  <li>There is a labour surplus; those with skills and education fuel the economy. </li>
  <li>The “skill gap” in many host countries can be filled by migrants. </li>
  <li>Costs of retirement can be transferred to the country of origin. </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="negatives-1">Negatives</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Migrant children must be educated, they won’t necessarily speak the native language of the host country. </li>
  <li>There is an over dependency in some industries on migrant labour, leading to a lack of jobs for people native to the host country. </li>
  <li>Much of the money earned by the migrants isn’t spent in the host country and is instead sent back to the country of origin. </li>
  <li>More people increase the pressure on resources  and services such as health care systems. </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="social-impacts-1">Social Impacts</h3>

<h4 id="positive-2">Positive</h4>

<ul>
  <li>The creation of a multiethnic society increases understanding and tolerance of other cultures. </li>
  <li>There is an influx of new or revitalised services e.g. Kebab shops &amp; Turkish baths. </li>
  <li>People from other countries can encourage the learning of new languages, helping people develop skills for working internationally. </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="negatives-2">Negatives</h4>

<ul>
  <li>The dominance of males is reinforced (due to the large number of male migrants), especially in cultures where women already have a low status. </li>
  <li>Aspects of cultural identity are lost, especially in second generation children. </li>
  <li>Segregated ethnic areas are created e.g. China Town. Schools become dominated by migrant children. </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="political-impacts-1">Political Impacts</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Discrimination agains ethnic groups &amp; minorities which can lead to civil unrest and extremism. </li>
  <li>Calls for control on immigration. </li>
  <li>Entrenchment of attitudes which may encourage fundamentalism. </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="immigration-control">Immigration Control</h2>

<h3 id="on-the-mexico---usa-border">On The Mexico - USA Border</h3>

<ul>
  <li>9,150 border control agents. </li>
  <li>Use of electronic equipment such as heat sensors, night vision goggles, air vehicles &amp; Black Hawk helicopters. </li>
  <li>Multiple operations to keep mexican immigrants out; Operation Rio Grande in the El Paso; Operation Gatekeeper in San Diego; Operation Hold-The-Line in El Paso; and operation safeguard in Tucson. </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="in-other-areas">In Other Areas</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Limiting the number of migrant workers at the source.</li>
  <li>Insisting on boundary arrangements. </li>
  <li>Preventing illegal crossings e.g. Sea patrols between Florida and Cuba. </li>
  <li>Returning ineligible asylum seekers. </li>
  <li>Use of holding bases for visa checks. </li>
</ul>
