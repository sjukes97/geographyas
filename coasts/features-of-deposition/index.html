	<h1><b>Features of Deposition</b></h1>
</div>
<p>Deposition occurs when accumulation of sediment exceeds removal. It usually takes place in a low energy environment. Landforms resulting from deposition include beaches, bars, tombolos, sand dunes &amp; salt marshes. </p>

<h2 id="spits">Spits</h2>

<p>A spit is a stretch of sand or shingle, attached to the mainland, that stretches into the sea. As material accumulates on a beach, it is transported along the beach via longshore drift in the direction of the prevailing wind. When the material reaches a river’s mouth, the (stronger) energy of the river prevents the sand from moving any further and it begins to accumulate. At this point, only the finest sediment can be transported out to sea. As the sand builds up, a spit forms, that extends out into the water but not beyond the river since the river will remove any sediment that crosses its path. The area behind the spit is a low energy environment since the spit provides shelter from the sea and, as a result of the low energy, a salt marsh begins to form behind the spit. </p>

<p>Often, spits will form around headlands that are close to river mouths since the headland provides shelter from the prevailing wind and helps create the lower energy environment necessary to build up a spit. As a result, wave refraction around the headland will push the spit in land, creating the distinctive curved shape of a spit. </p>

<p>The easiest way to demonstrate the formation of a spit is with a diagram.  </p>

<p><img src="/Images/coasts/8depositionalFeatures/spitFormationDiagram.png" alt="Diagram showing the formation of a spit." /></p>

<p>Spits are not permanent features. They are eroded, albeit slowly, by the sea and if a particularly large storm comes along, entire spits can be wiped out. As spits are created and destroyed, it can appear as if they are migrating and so the location and shape of spits is constantly changing. </p>

<p>Using Google Earth or Google Maps, it’s possible to see the shape of different spits from an aerial perspective. Try <a href="http://maps.google.com/?ll=53.60916,0.14170&amp;z=12&amp;t=h">Spurn Head</a> for a good example. Using Google Earth, it’s possible to look at past satellite images of the area too and in the case of some spits, it’s possible to see just how much they’ve changed in the past few years. </p>

<h2 id="bars">Bars</h2>

<p>If a spit forms between the two headlands defining a bay and there is no strong flow of water, the spit can cut off the bay by stretching between the two headlands. The spit is then known as a bar. An example of a bar is Slapton Ley in Devon. Again, it’s possible to see this landform using <a href="http://maps.google.com/?ll=50.25656,-3.61209&amp;z=12&amp;t=h">Google Maps</a></p>

<h2 id="tombolos">Tombolos</h2>

<p>Quite simply, a tombolo is a spit that has joined an island to the mainland. A good example of this is <a href="http://maps.google.com/?ll=50.57250,-2.46026&amp;z=14&amp;t=h">Chesil Beach</a> which joins the Isle of Portland to the mainland. </p>

<h2 id="haloseressalt-marshes">Haloseres/Salt Marshes</h2>

<p><em>Need an example of a salt marsh? Parkgate’s a good one. It’s located in the Wirral and has delicious ice creams.</em></p>

<p>A halosere is an ecological succession that develops in a salty environment. Guess where you can find salt? Besides on your table, yeah, the sea. Haloseres will nearly always form on coastlines and the most common type of halosere is a salt marsh. Salt marshes are interesting coastal landforms in that some people love them and some people hate them. They’re pretty popular with bird watchers and (obviously) geographers but sailors hate them and a lot of people think they’re ugly and would rather destroy them. Salt marshes are important coastal landforms though as they provide a very effective, sustainable method for <a href="/coasts/coastal-management/#marshland-creation">defending a coastline</a> against coastal erosion. </p>

<p>Salt marshes can only form in very low energy environments. The most common place to find salt marshes is behind a spit (known as the ‘lee’ of a spit (see above)) where there is stationary water and the area is shielded from the wind and waves. There still must be an input into the stationary water and the input must contain silt and clay. The best source of such an input is a river, even more reason for a salt marsh to form behind a spit. When the river meets the sea a process called flocculation takes place (you may have heard of this when studying deltas) where the silt and clay interact with the salt in the sea and fall out of solution. As the silt and clay fall out of solution and settle on the sea bed a mudflat forms. This process is known as (coastal) accretion. </p>

<p>In order to speed up coastal accretion, halophytic plants can be introduced. Halophytes are salt loving plants that can survive in the harsh conditions of the mudflats. They don’t mind salt water and can stand being submerged by it for several hours a day. They’re really tough plants and are often referred to as pioneer species since they’re the first things to live on a salt marsh. Examples of halophytes include grasswort and spartina. These plants have special adaptations to allow them to survive on the mudflats. Spartina, for example, have long roots that enable them to tap into the water table and access fresh water. They can also filter salt out of water so the need for these long roots is kind of negated by that fact. Glasswort is a fairly interesting species of plants since it is able to shed layers off of it. This is advantageous since it can get rid of build ups of salt and mud on its surface and so can continue to photosynthesise.</p>

<p>These halophytic plants help to speed up accretion by trapping mud and salt and forcing it to settle, gradually building up the depth of the mudflats. The accretion process is further aided by the build up of organic matter in the mudflat which not only increases the mudflats depth but also provides nutrients for new species of plants to grow. </p>

<p>As the salt marsh develops and the mudflats build up, new species of plants begin to grow including sea rush and the common reed. These plants only grow inland, away from the mudflats, since they’re not halophytes (you could call them halophobes). They <em>really</em> don’t like being submerged in water and can’t stand salt. Interestingly though, the seeds of the sea rush can germinate underwater which could be seen as stupid or clever, depending on how you look at it. </p>

<h3 id="the-attack-of-the-salt-marshes">The Attack of the Salt Marshes</h3>

<p>Salt marshes are really nice landforms in my opinion but a lot of people disagree. Many sailors hate the things since the plants that grow in salt marshes will jam up a ship’s motor. Worse yet, salt marshes develop in low energy areas, which is just where sailors like to ‘park’ their boats. Where I live, the Wirral, there’s an extensive salt marsh system that’s developed in an area called Parkgate. Just 100 years ago, Parkgate was a pretty big shipping area but now its basically dry land since a salt marsh developed uncontrollably in the area. This was due to two factors. First, the Dee Estuary (onto which Parkgate sits) had been dredged in order to improve its shipping capacity. This ended up harming shipping since it provided a large volume of sediment for a salt marsh to develop on. The second factor was the presence of the invasive spartina plant. The plant isn’t actually native to the UK, and was imported by ships coming in from America. The plant grows incredibly quickly though, which is why the salt marsh was able to develop in just a few decades. </p>

<h3 id="the-revenge-of-the-humans">The Revenge of the Humans</h3>

<p>Since salt marshes are pretty bad for business, people try to prevent salt marshes from developing since once they’ve developed, they’re pretty hard to get rid of. It’s common for people to engage in cleansing sessions where they basically try to remove all the plants that are growing on the forming salt marsh. This will seriously impede the marsh’s development since the only way for the marshes to build up would be via flocculation, which is very slow.</p>

<p>Once a marsh has developed though, as I said, they’re hard to get rid of. But hey, look on the bright side, you’ve got some new land to build on! People will often try to build things on marshes and such activity is known as land reclamation. It’s not really a good thing since salt marshes are home to many species of plants, birds and other fauna whose habitats are destroyed when people build on salt marshes. </p>

<p>Marshes are also at risk from agricultural damage. Salt marshes can be drained in order to provide land for cattle to be herded which can result in a reduction in biodiversity in the salt marsh as cattle selectively eat certain species of plants. It will also result in the death of many plants because of trampling. There’s also the issue of agricultural run off. Fertiliser that runs into salt marshes can be particularly dangerous as a process called eutrophication can take place. This is where algae in the water receive the nutrients in the fertiliser and begin multiplying like crazy. They form an opaque layer on top of water surfaces which prevents oxygen &amp; sunlight from reaching anything beneath the surface of the algae and hence kills and plants and animals beneath the surface. Not only that, it makes the water look pretty disgusting too. </p>

<p>The other risk to salt marshes actually isn’t due to humans (well, it could be). Sea level rise would be pretty devastating to salt marshes since they’re very low lying land forms and a very small rise is enough to flood and destroy them. </p>

<h2 id="the-revenge-of-the-humans-against-the-humans-who-are-getting-revenge-on-the-salt-marshes">The Revenge of the Humans Against the Humans Who Are Getting Revenge on the Salt Marshes</h2>

<p>Fortunately, there are some people who want to protect salt marshes (hello!) since they provide a very nice habitat for many species of animals. Unfortunately, there’s not a lot we can do to defend them against sea level rise since if we built a big barrier in front of the marsh to keep back any rising water, we’d slowly destroy the marsh anyway since it would no longer receive any inputs. </p>

<p>Even more unfortunate is the fact that there’s not a lot we can do to stop other people from destroying the marshes. Agricultural waste, by nature, is going to end up in marshes since it’s <em>always</em> going to enter the water cycle. People are going to continue to destroy the marshes because they house a threat to their businesses too. The best we can do is preserve the currently existing salt marshes by making them SSSIs (Sites of Special Scientific Interest) and entrusting them with conservation groups. The salt marsh at Parkgate, for example, is both an SSSI and an RSPB (Royal Society for the Protection of Birds) protected wetland since it has many species of rare birds nesting in it. </p>

<h2 id="psammoseressand-dunes">Psammoseres/Sand Dunes</h2>

<p>A psammosere is a community of ecological successions on a coastal system. The most common example of a Psammosere is a sand dune succession. The succession of sand dunes has a variety of ecological differences as you move further inland, making it a psammosere. </p>

<p>For sand dunes to form, several conditions are necessary. The section of coast must have a large tidal range as this will allow large amounts of sediment (the bed of the ocean of sea) to be exposed to winds. The presence of a prevailing wind is also greatly beneficial since this will provide powerful winds to transport the sand inland. Alternatively, a long fetch will help since this will provide high energy winds to move the sand inland. The wind will transport sediment on the bed of the sea via saltation during low tide. The sediment will move until it meets an obstacle which is normally found at the strand line. This is the maximum extent of the tide and is where lots of rubbish gets deposited. The rubbish will act as an obstacle and cause the sand to build up behind the rubbish forming embryo dunes. From this, a sand dune system begins to form. </p>

<p><img src="/Images/coasts/8depositionalFeatures/sandDuneSystem.png" alt="A diagram of a sand dune succession outlining the different types of sand dunes." /></p>

<h3 id="the-features-of-sand-dune-successions">The Features of Sand Dune Successions</h3>

<p>As the sand dune system moves inland, many changes take place to the sand dunes in terms of appearance, shape, size and the types of vegetation present in the sand dunes.</p>

<p>At the back of the beach, there is little in terms of sand dune development. Small mounds of sand may be beginning to develop behind deposited litter but they will be unable to grow too tall as the tide can still reach this section of the beach, destroying the developing dunes. The sand here has a very high pH caused by the presence of many discarded sea creature’s shells. These shells decompose and release alkali materials creating the alkaline conditions. Plant life is scarce, contributing to the high pH by lowering the availability of decomposing organic matter. Plants that do develop here are known as “pioneer species” and are particularly tough plants as they have to survive strong winds, salty conditions and being fully submerged in water for several hours straight. Examples of these pioneer plants include sea rocket and prickly saltwort. </p>

<p>A small distance inland, the first sand dunes begin to develop, referred to as <em>embryo dunes</em>. These dunes are relatively small in size and are nothing more than small bumps in the ground. Non-the-less, they represent an opportunity for plant life to develop and certain species of plants can grow on these embryo dunes, binding the sand together and acting as an obstacle to help more sand build up and the height of the sand dune to grow even more. Plants that grow on these embryo dunes include sea couch and lyme. These plants are able to grow vertically upwards through accumulating sand and possess several special adaptations to help them survive in the harsh conditions present on embryo dunes. To begin, these plants are xenophobic, so they are drought loving plants and are able to survive without water for extensive periods of time. These plants are also specially adapted to collect whatever water is available. They have long roots that allow them to tap into the water table and many species of plants have specially adapted leaves that help to collect water. The long roots also help to stabilise the plants in the sand, preventing them from being blown away in strong winds. This has the knock on effect of binding the sand and aiding sand dune growth. </p>

<p>Further inland again, foredunes (also referred to as mobile dunes) begin to develop. Larger than their embryonic cousins, these foredunes have new types of plant life developing on them as conditions become slightly easier for life. Marram grass develops on foredunes (and sometimes on embryo dunes too) which has many interesting adaptations for living in sand dunes. Like many species of plants, it has long roots to tap into the water supply. It is, however, marram grass’s shape that is interesting. Marram grass is a long, thin and spiky plant which helps to protect it from strong winds by making the marram grass more aerodynamic. What’s more interesting though is that the grass’s shape can change according to the weather conditions. During calm weather, the grass will be quite flat horizontally, allowing it to collect more water. However when the winds pick up, the grass folds in half, making it far more aerodynamic and reducing its chances of being damaged by the wind. </p>

<p>The pH of the soil that makes up foredunes begins to fall as the sand dune system moves inland. The soil becomes more acidic since organic matter from dead plants and animals begins to build up in the soil. This is evident from both the changing pH and the changing colour of the sand. The sand that makes up foredunes close to the back of the beach is very yellow due to the low concentration of organic matter, however further inland, the sand begins to turn grey due to a build up of organic matter. To differentiate between the differing soil, sections of the sand dune systems are divided into yellow dunes and grey dunes, indicating the acidity of the soil and concentration of plant life in an area. </p>

<p>The height of foredunes will eventually peak, after which the height of the dunes begins to fall again. The tallest dune is often referred to as the dune ridge and it’s after the dune ridge that plant life begins to change and more organic matter begins to build up as the dune ridge acts as a shelter for sand dunes behind it, shielding them from strong winds which helps create the right conditions for new plant life to develop but prevents dunes from growing too large by limiting the amount of sand they are exposed to. </p>

<p>Dunes developing after the dune ridge are normally grey dunes and have a much lower height. Fixed dunes generally develop first. The more sheltered nature of fixed dunes means that flowering plants and moss begin to develop and marram grass becomes far less common. It is replaced with a type of grass known as fescue grass. </p>

<p>Between dunes beyond the dune ridge dune slacks can develop. These are depressions between the sand dunes that are low enough that the ground is very close to, or on, the water table. This creates very moist conditions and allows new plants to develop including reeds and rushes. </p>

<p>Beyond the dune slacks and fixed dunes, the sand begins to run out and the development of sand dunes stops. Woodlands with trees such as pine and oak begin to develop and a climatic climax begins to develop. That is, unless humans interfere. In many sand dune systems, humans have interfered by planting conifers in the sand dunes in an attempt to stabilise them, which leads to the formation of a plagio-climax and different types of vegetation beyond the sand dunes. </p>

<h3 id="sand-dune-blowouts">Sand Dune Blowouts</h3>

<p>A blowout is a feature of sand dune successions that marks the location of a now destroyed sand dune. They are thought to be caused by the destruction of plants within a sand dune due to trampling by humans. As the plants die, the roots that bind the sand dunes together and help to stabilise the sand dunes die as well. This results in the sand dunes being unsupported and, during strong winds, a large section of sand is removed from the sand dune forming a large concave depression within the sand dune known as a blow out. </p>

<p>While blow outs are destructive to sand dunes, they can help develop the overall ecological system by providing a sheltered niche for new species of plants to grow in. </p>

<h3 id="sand-dune-protection">Sand Dune Protection</h3>

<p>Sand dune systems are relatively fragile systems and are highly susceptible to damage and interference from humans. We therefore take it upon ourselves to protect sand dune systems and we do so using a variety of methods. Many of the methods used are soft engineering techniques so they are low cost, low technology and work with nature. </p>

<p>Sand dunes, more specifically the vegetation that covers sand dunes, are susceptible to a process known as trampling which is were humans (or other animals) crush plants on sand dunes that can lead to the aforementioned blow outs. In order to limit trampling and prevent blow outs, sand dune management takes place and restricted access is granted to areas of sand dune systems. Footpaths are constructed to limit the trampling of plants to certain areas and these footpaths are fenced off in order to prevent people from wondering off onto sand dunes. Some types of footpaths, known as boardwalks, are made of wooden slats in them which allow plants to grow underneath the boardwalks and therefore continue to bind the sand in that particular area. </p>

<p>Educating tourists is a particularly effective way of reducing damage to sand dunes. Information boards will limit the number of tourists who simply ignore the “no access” signs by actually providing them with a reason to obey them. </p>

<p>In order to stabilise sand dunes, dead fern trees can be planted in the sand to help trap the sand and build up new sand dunes. These trees will also bind the sand very well, making the sand dunes stable for many years. </p>

<p><img src="/Images/coasts/8depositionalFeatures/sandDunePineBuildUpFormby.jpg" alt="An image showing trees that have been planted at Formby Sand Dunes to help rebuild the dunes" /></p>

<p>The above image, taken at Formby Sand Dunes, shows the amazing result of planting dead trees to help build up sand dunes. The more recent trees can be seen close to the surface but the entire sand dune system visible is the result of soft engineering techniques. The area photographed is also an “out of bounds” area and has a sign stating that unauthorised access is not allowed. </p>
