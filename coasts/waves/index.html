</div>
<p>Waves are a medium through which energy is transferred. They are created by the wind blowing across the surface of the sea. Frictional drag increases as the wind speed increases, making the wave bigger. </p>

<p>Wave energy depends upon three things:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The strength of the wind.</li>
  <li>The length of time the wind has blown for. </li>
  <li>The fetch of the wind (the distance it blows over).</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="wave-motion">Wave Motion</h2>

<p>When the water a wave is travelling in becomes shallow, the normal circular motion a wave travels in begins to become elliptical due to the increased friction with the sea bed. This causes the wave to slow down and causes its height to increase. As the steepness of the wave increases, it becomes less stable and, when the steepness exceeds a 7:1 (height:length) ratio, the wave breaks. </p>

<h3 id="constructivesurging-waves">Constructive/Surging Waves</h3>

<p><img src="/Images/coasts/2waves/constructiveWaveDiagram.png" alt="Diagram of constructive wave." /></p>

<p>Constructive waves have a short amplitude and a long wavelength. They have a low frequency of around 6-8 waves per minute. Constructive waves produce a strong swash, but a weak backwash, which produces a gentle beach as material is deposited but not removed from the beach. The supply of new material and the constant action of pushing the material up the beach eventually produces berms. </p>

<h3 id="destructivesurfing-waves">Destructive/Surfing Waves</h3>

<p><img src="/Images/coasts/2waves/destructiveWaveDiagram.png" alt="Diagram of destructive wave." /></p>

<p>Destructive waves have a high amplitude and a short wavelength. They also have a high frequency of 10-14 waves per minute. The waves have a strong backwash but a weak swash, so they remove a lot of material from the beach producing a steeper beach profile. The force of destructive waves can fire material to the back of the beach where a ridge known as a storm beach forms.</p>
