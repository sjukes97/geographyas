<h3 id="hydraulic-action">Hydraulic Action</h3>

<p>Also known as <em>wave quarrying</em>, when a wave breaks onto a cliff, it traps a large amount of air behind it. The air is forced into cracks in the cliff with an immense amount of pressure. When the water retreats, the air is released from the cracks and a miniature explosive decompression takes place, weakening the cliff. Over time, the cliff can be weakened to the point at which a small storm will be enough to cause it to collapse. </p>

<h3 id="corrasionabrasion">Corrasion/Abrasion</h3>

<p>Sand, shingle and boulders picked up by waves act as sandpaper on other rocks causing them to be ground away and eroded over time. The material that the waves pick up can also be thrown up against cliffs, causing extensive damage due to the force of the rocks impacting the cliff. </p>

<h3 id="attrition">Attrition</h3>

<p>Beach material is eroded as a result of rocks and pebbles constantly hitting each other in the water. The material is worn down into more circular pieces. </p>

<h3 id="corrosion">Corrosion</h3>

<p>Many coastal rocks are susceptible to corrosion by salt water. Limestone coasts are susceptible to carbonation, where limestone is dissolved by carbonic acid in the sea. This process depends on the saturation of the sea however as if it contains too much calcium carbonate (CaCo<sub>3</sub>), carbonation won’t occur. </p>

<p>While this isn’t strictly a form of erosion, the pressure of sea salt on rocks can also be considered a form of erosion. When sea water evaporates, the salt in it remains on the rocks and crystallises. The crystallisation causes the salt to expand and become heavier, straining the rocks and eventually causing them to fracture. </p>

<h2 id="factors-effecting-the-rate-of-erosion">Factors Effecting The Rate Of Erosion</h2>

<ul>
  <li>The geology of the coast is very important. Limestone coasts will be more easily eroded, while coasts made from harder rock types will be eroded much more slowly. </li>
  <li>The size of the fetch will effect coastal erosion as a long fetch will produce stronger waves with more energy allowing them to do more damage via hydraulic action. </li>
  <li>The <a href="/coasts/waves/#constructive--destructive-waves">wave type</a> effects the type of beach present and hence the erosion of the coast as different shaped beaches dissipate wave energy at different rates. </li>
  <li>The type of beach (sand or shingle), which itself effects the shape of the beach.</li>
  <li>Beaches help to absorb the energy of waves and reduce the effect of erosion on the coast. Steep beaches dissipate the energy of waves well and more gradual beaches have the effect of spreading the energy out. </li>
  <li>Rock structure/geology/lithology.</li>
  <li>Shape of the coastline.</li>
  <li>Wave refraction.</li>
  <li>Humans play an important role in the erosion of coasts. Humans often construct sea defences which can reduce erosion in a certain area. However, these defences can have the knock-on effect of increasing erosion in other areas. Humans can also remove natural defences, which can in turn increase erosion in an area. The removal or alteration of beaches can increase erosion of a coast.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="lithology">Lithology</h2>

<p><em>Lithology</em> is a term used to describe the properties of a rock, such as it’s resistance to erosion. A coast whose lithology is composed of granite will be eroded very slowly, while a coast whose lithology is composed of limestone will be eroded far more quickly. An important consideration regarding the lithology of a coast is how the different types of rocks are arranged. When different layers of rocks are arranged parallel to each other, a concordant coastline is formed whereas when the different layers are at right angles to the coastline, a discordant coastline is formed. </p>

<h3 id="concordant-coasts">Concordant Coasts</h3>

<p><img src="/Images/coasts/5coastalErosion/concordantCoastDiagram.png" alt="A diagram showing the arrangement of rock layers on a concordant coastline." /></p>

<h3 id="discordant-coasts">Discordant Coasts</h3>

<p><img src="/Images/coasts/5coastalErosion/discordantCoastDiagram.png" alt="A diagram showing rock layers that run at 90 degrees to the coastline as is the case on discordant coastlines." /></p>

<h2 id="dip">Dip</h2>

<p>The stability and steepness of a cliff is dependent on the <em>dip</em> of its bedding layers. Beds which dip towards the sea produce gentle cliffs which are unstable. Beds which dip away from the sea or are horizontal produce steep, stable cliffs. </p>

<p><img src="/Images/coasts/5coastalErosion/horizontalBeddingLayersDiagram.png" alt="A cliff with horizontal bedding layers." /></p>

<p>The above cliff has horizontal bedding layers with no dip. This causes the cliff to be steep and stable. The same sort of cliff would be produced if the bed layers dipped away from the sea.</p>
