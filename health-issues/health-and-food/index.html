	<h1><b>Health & Food</b></h1>
</div>
<p><em>Malnutrition</em> is a condition resulting from a dietary deficiency, such as a lack of access to a specific nutrient or due to a lack of access to food in general. </p>

<p><em>Undernourishment</em> is simply when people consume too little food over a certain period of time.</p>

<h2 id="famine">Famine</h2>

<h3 id="causes">Causes</h3>

<ul>
  <li><em>Drought</em> - A lack of rainfall leads to a lack of water in the water table for plants. This can result in crops failing and the death of livestock, leading to food shortages, primarily for subsistence farmers, but in more extreme cases whole countries. </li>
  <li><em>Disease</em> - A spread of disease through crops can quickly eliminate a years harvest leading to mass famine.</li>
  <li><em>Population Increase</em> - If the population of an area increases too quickly, perhaps due to an influx of refugees, the food supplies may not be able to scale to the demand, leading to a famine. </li>
  <li><em>Cost</em> - When the quantity of available food and livestock falls, the demand and hence cost of food increases. As food prices inflate, people become unable to afford food and begin to starve. </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="famine-in-ethiopia">Famine in Ethiopia</h2>

<h3 id="location">Location</h3>

<p>Ethiopia itself is located in the east of Africa to the south of the country of Eritrea, north of Kenya. The area is landlocked due to Eritrea splitting off during a civil war. The areas affected by the civil war include Eritrea and Tiya, where the civil war has been taking place. Refugees from the civil war in these areas have fled to Koram, which hosted the majority of the famished during a famine in 1984. More recently, a drought in Ethiopia has led to famine in Gode, in the south of Ethiopia. </p>

<h3 id="when">When</h3>

<ul>
  <li>The initial famines due to civil war and drought were in 1984 - 1985. </li>
  <li>Famines occurred again in 2000 due to drought. </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="cause">Cause</h3>

<ul>
  <li>In all cases, drought led to the failure of crops which resulted in famines. In 2000 and 1984-1985 there had been poor rainfall for 3 years. This causes crops to fail and also forced herdsman to slaughter their cattle. The slaughtering of cattle was unusual, since the cattle are generally used for milking, not for meat. </li>
  <li>The lack of rain was due to cooler sea temperatures in the Atlantic &amp; Pacific, so less evaporation occurred and hence less rain fell. </li>
  <li>A civil war between Ethiopia and Eritrea had been waged for several years and made it difficult to get food into Ethiopia, including aid, since Ethiopia is landlocked and Eritrea was the only country to have access to a port. In addition, it soon emerged that some of the aid that had been sent over to Ethiopia had been used to feed Ethiopian soldiers and the vehicles used to transport the aid were used for military use. </li>
  <li>The population of Ethiopia had grown exponentially by 2000 meaning there was too little food to feed the population. </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="effects">Effects</h3>

<ul>
  <li>In the 1984 famine, 40,000 refugees in Koran were at risk of starving. Of the 40,000 people, some 15,000 children were effected by the famine. A third of these children were severely malnourished.</li>
  <li>In the 1984 famine, 1 person died every 20 minutes due to undernourishment. </li>
  <li>During the 2000 famine, 95% of the livestock had been killed either due to the drought or by their herdsmen, desperate for food. </li>
  <li>1 million people were killed in both famines. </li>
  <li>The price of food during the 2000 famine rose greatly due to the mass migration of farmers and livestock in search of water and fresh ground. This put substantial pressure on places where there wasn’t enough water and pasture, leading to more deaths.</li>
  <li>Due to the killing of cattle that were intended to be used for milk, milk became scarce leading to malnutrition, especially in pregnant women and children. </li>
  <li>The 2000 famine effected 43% of the population.</li>
  <li>The conditions of the refugee camps and the presence of malnourishment in them led to the spread of diseases such as TB. </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="responses">Responses</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Initially, multiple non government organisations such as Oxfam and Doctors Without Borders attempted to provide aid for those in need. Eventually, international governments became involved in providing aid. </li>
  <li>Live Aid was immensely successful at raising awareness and money for the famine and was responsible for getting governments involved in providing aid to Ethiopia. </li>
  <li>An early warning system was setup to predict poor rainfall so that food and aid can be acquired in preparation. </li>
  <li>Since the 1984 drought, the government holds 350,000 (metric) tonnes of food in reserve in the of a drought. The resources are supposed to be replenished as soon as they are used but during the 2000 drought, the reserves fell to 50,000 tonnes without being replaced. </li>
  <li>Donations of clothing and dry food from the west. </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="problems-with-responses">Problems With Responses</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Aid wasn’t well distributed. The poor infrastructure of Ethiopia and its landlocked nature made getting aid into the country hard. </li>
  <li>When Ethiopia appealed for aid, the world didn’t respond with aid due to other problems in the world and reports that donated money was going into the army rather than towards food.</li>
  <li>Medical workers were killed due to the ongoing civil war. </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="issues-relating-to-famine">Issues relating to Famine</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Over dependence on aid by countries can result in a worsened situation and damage to the agricultural economy. </li>
  <li>Disaster fatigue, were people become tired of donating money or want to do more to help than donating money but can’t. </li>
  <li>Coordination between aid agencies and governments can fall apart during crisis resulting wasted aid and more deaths.</li>
  <li>Any food sent must be non-perishable, easily transported and of local tastes. During the 1984 famine in Ethiopia, a stupid mistake meant people sent powdered milk to a country suffering from <strong>drought</strong>. Powdered milk requires water.  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="obesity">Obesity</h2>

<ul>
  <li><em>Obesity</em> is the excessive gain of weight to the point at which it impairs health. It is generally caused when the total calorie (and hence energy) intake is greater than the calorie (energy) output. </li>
  <li><em>BMI</em> is a weight to height ratio that is used to determine when a person is overweight, underweight or obese. It is calculated using:</li>

<p>These BMI categories are not applicable for children. </p>

<p>Obesity is a global issue and is especially prevalent in MEDCs, more so in women. In the USA, 45% of the female population is obese. Throughout Europe, Argentina &amp; Russia, 30-45% of the female population is obese. Conversely for men, in the USA, 30-45% of the male population is obese while in Europe and Australia the obesity levels stand at 15-29% of the male population. Russia has an obesity rate of 8-14.9% among its males. Finally, 8% of the male population is obese in nearly all of Africa, India, China &amp; Japan. </p>

<h2 id="obesity-statistics">Obesity Statistics</h2>

<ul>
  <li>1.6 million people in the world are overweight, of which 400 million are obese. </li>
  <li>In the USA, 35% of children are obese. </li>
</ul>

<p>Within the UK, obesity is becoming a major problem. In 2010, nearly 70% of the population was overweight or obese and the National Health Service predicts that 27,000 deaths per year are caused by complications relating to the prevalence of diabetes, a disease commonly associated with obesity. The most common group of people effected by obesity are the poor, working class as they can’t afford healthy food which is more expensive than processed food and has a far shorter shelf life. </p>

<p>Childhood obesity is also on the rise within the UK, largely due to a dramatic decrease in the activity levels of children. Significantly less children walk to school now than did two to three decades ago. In addition, the majority of children now watch about a days worth of television each weak so they are no longer very active. The TV they watch is also stuffed full of adverts for unhealthy foods that are specifically targeted at children. </p>

<p>The UK government runs the Change 4 Life programme, an attempt to get families more active and eating healthier food. Other programmes include a programme to encourage children to walk to school rather than taking a car or bus to make them more active and to help the environment. The London 2012 olympics have also sparked an interest throughout the UK in sports again and the UK government has launched several programmes to take advantage of the hype surrounding the Olympics. </p>

<h2 id="causes--consequences-of-obesity">Causes &amp; Consequences Of Obesity</h2>

<p>In the past 4 decades, obesity levels have risen greatly throughout the world. This is largely due to the increase in high calorie foods that are consumed. People are consuming more food that is high in calories, sugar and fat. Coupled with this is the fact that people are becoming less active thanks to the less active forms of work that people now engage in. The availability of powered transport and desk jobs have significantly reduced people’s activity. </p>

<p>The health risks of obesity are substantial. As the BMI of an individual increases, the health issues that they are at risk of also increase. The risk of coronary heart disease is substantially increased for the obese. Further more, people are more at risk at contracting several types of cancers, osteoarthritis and diabetes. Diabetes is now considered a global epidemic by the WHO who predict that deaths from diabetes will increase by 50% within the next ten years. </p>

<p>In addition to these health issues, obesity has several non health related problems too. Vehicles have to be designed to seat large people, extra wide clothing, doors, even coffins are in high demand. Airliners, for example, must now reconsider the luggage weight of passengers as the increasing weight of people is becoming problematic for flying. </p>

<p>Within countries where malnutrition is present, many people are also over weight, often within individual families as other members of the family are starved in order to feed the obese individuals. </p>

<h2 id="limiting--reducing-obesity">Limiting &amp; Reducing Obesity</h2>

<p>In nearly all cases it’s possible to prevent obesity from happening in a person and, once a person is obese, it is possible (but difficult) for them to loose weight and achieve a “normal” weight again. The best way to reduce and limit obesity is to monitor food intake. Reducing sugar intake, fat intake and limiting calorie intake to the sufficient amount will help reduce obesity greatly. Planning diets so that only the necessary amount of food is consumed will help reduce obesity. In addition to managing food intake, increasing exercise will also help reduce obesity. Carrying out regular exercise will balance out the calories consumed, preventing obesity from developing. </p>

<p>Reducing obesity is backed by many organisations including governments, charities and the food industry itself. Government led initiatives to help reduce obesity within a country have proven to be successful. A common technique is to introduce changes to education programmes within schools so that there is more of a focus on healthy eating and exercise, either by increasing the importance of these topics within subjects or by altering school meals and increasing the amount of mandatory exercise per week in schools. Government led initiatives for adults are more limited. In the UK, the Change 4 Life programme has attempted to improve the health of both children and adults with a particularly family orientated nature. Food companies have attempted to improve the healthiness of their food by reducing the salt, fat, saturated fat and sugar levels within their foods. They have been motivated to do this due to government programmes were healthy foods receive far more publicity and more attractive marketing terms than unhealthy foods. </p>

<h3 id="coping-with-obesity-in-brazil">Coping With Obesity In Brazil</h3>

<p>Brazil implemented several different laws to try and reduce obesity within the country before it developed to too high levels. The government led Family Health Programme helps to raise awareness of different exercise programmes and healthy food choices. In addition, the government closely monitors obesity trends within adults and children to attempt to prevent any increases in obesity before it actually happens. Food advertising laws mean that foods that receive TV time or space in a newspaper and are high in fat and sugar have to put warning signs within the advert to alert consumers of the potential health risks (similar to the health warnings found on cigarette packets). </p>
